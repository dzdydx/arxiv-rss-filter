In this paper, we propose an interpretable deep learning model on Residual Networks (ResNets) for automatically diagnosing paediatric pneumonia on chest X-rays. We enhance interpretability through Bayesian Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (BayesGrad-CAM), which quantifies uncertainty in visual explanations, and which offers spatial locations accountable for the decision-making process of the model. Our ResNet-50 model, trained on a large paediatric chest X-rays dataset, achieves high classification accuracy (95.94%), AUC-ROC (98.91%), and Cohen's Kappa (0.913), accompanied by clinically meaningful visual explanations. Our findings demonstrate that high performance and interpretability are not only achievable but critical for clinical AI deployment."

We observe that, even within the same domain, cross-dataset distribution shifts can cause severe catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning. To address this, we first train a base model on a source distribution and then adapt it to each new target distribution by creating separate branches, fine-tuning only selected components while keeping the original source branch fixed. Based on a component-wise analysis, we identify effective fine-tuning strategies for target distributions that enable parameter-efficient adaptation. At inference time, we propose using a supervised contrastive learning model to identify the input distribution and dynamically route it to the corresponding branch. Our framework achieves near-optimal F1-scores while using significantly fewer parameters than training separate models for each distribution."

        "summary": "arXiv:2507.18654v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Diffusion models are powerful tools for sampling from high-dimensional distributions by progressively transforming pure noise into structured data through a denoising process. When equipped with a guidance mechanism, these models can also generate samples from conditional distributions. In this paper, a novel diffusion-based framework is introduced for solving inverse problems using a piecewise guidance scheme. The guidance term is defined as a piecewise function of the diffusion timestep, facilitating the use of different approximations during high-noise and low-noise phases. This design is shown to effectively balance computational efficiency with the accuracy of the guidance term. Unlike task-specific approaches that require retraining for each problem, the proposed method is problem-agnostic and readily adaptable to a variety of inverse problems. Additionally, it explicitly incorporates measurement noise into the reconstruction process. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through extensive experiments on image restoration tasks, specifically image inpainting and super-resolution. Using a class conditional diffusion model for recovery, compared to the \\pgdm baseline, the proposed framework achieves a reduction in inference time of \\(25\\%\\) for inpainting with both random and center masks, and \\(23\\%\\) and \\(24\\%\\) for \\(4\\times\\) and \\(8\\times\\) super-resolution tasks, respectively, while incurring only negligible loss in PSNR and SSIM."

In parallel, the field of human parsing focuses on predicting body part and clothing/accessory labels from images. This work aims to bridge these two domains by enabling per-vertex semantic segmentation of large-scale human meshes. To achieve this, a pseudo-ground truth labeling pipeline is developed for the Thuman2.1 dataset: meshes are first aligned to a canonical pose, segmented from multiple viewpoints, and the resulting point-level labels are then backprojected onto the original mesh to produce per-point pseudo ground truth annotations. Subsequently, a novel, memory-efficient sampling strategy is introduced, a windowed iterative farthest point sampling (FPS) with space-filling curve-based serialization to effectively downsample the point clouds. This is followed by a purely geometric segmentation using PointTransformer, enabling semantic parsing of human meshes without relying on texture information. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approach."

        "summary": "arXiv:2507.18656v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) significantly enhance road safety by detecting potential collisions and alerting drivers. However, their reliance on expensive sensor technologies such as LiDAR and radar limits accessibility, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Machine learning-based ADAS (ML-ADAS), leveraging deep neural networks (DNNs) with only standard camera input, offers a cost-effective alternative. Critical to ML-ADAS is the collision avoidance feature, which requires the ability to detect objects and estimate their distances accurately. This is achieved with specialized DNNs like YOLO, which provides real-time object detection, and a lightweight, detection-wise distance estimation approach that relies on key features extracted from the detections like bounding box dimensions and size. However, the robustness of these systems is undermined by security vulnerabilities in object detectors. In this paper, we introduce ShrinkBox, a novel backdoor attack targeting object detection in collision avoidance ML-ADAS. Unlike existing attacks that manipulate object class labels or presence, ShrinkBox subtly shrinks ground truth bounding boxes. This attack remains undetected in dataset inspections and standard benchmarks while severely disrupting downstream distance estimation. We demonstrate that ShrinkBox can be realized in the YOLOv9m object detector at an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 96%, with only a 4% poisoning ratio in the training instances of the KITTI dataset. Furthermore, given the low error targets introduced in our relaxed poisoning strategy, we find that ShrinkBox increases the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) in downstream distance estimation by more than 3x on poisoned samples, potentially resulting in delays or prevention of collision warnings altogether."

However, the traditional centralized learning paradigm poses serious privacy risks as all data is collected and trained on a single server. To mitigate this challenge, decentralized approaches such as federated learning and swarm learning have emerged, allowing model training on local nodes while sharing only model weights. While these methods enhance privacy, they struggle with heterogeneous and imbalanced data and suffer from inefficiencies due to frequent communication and the aggregation of weights. More critically, the dynamic and complex nature of clinical environments demands scalable AI systems capable of continuously learning from diverse modalities and multilabels. Yet, both centralized and decentralized models are prone to catastrophic forgetting during system expansion, often requiring full model retraining to incorporate new data. To address these limitations, we propose VGS-ATD, a novel distributed learning framework. To validate VGS-ATD, we evaluate it in experiments spanning 30 datasets and 80 independent labels across distributed nodes, VGS-ATD achieved an overall accuracy of 92.7%, outperforming centralized learning (84.9%) and swarm learning (72.99%), while federated learning failed under these conditions due to high requirements on computational resources. VGS-ATD also demonstrated strong scalability, with only a 1% drop in accuracy on existing nodes after expansion, compared to a 20% drop in centralized learning, highlighting its resilience to catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, it reduced computational costs by up to 50% relative to both centralized and swarm learning, confirming its superior efficiency and scalability."

In practice, when humans attempt to predict the next location in a trajectory, they often visualize the trajectory on a map and reason based on road connectivity and movement trends. However, the vast majority of existing next-location prediction models do not reason over maps \\textbf{in the way that humans do}. Fortunately, the recent development of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has demonstrated strong capabilities in visual perception and even visual reasoning. This opens up a new possibility: by rendering both the road network and trajectory onto an image and leveraging the reasoning abilities of VLMs, we can enable models to perform trajectory inference in a human-like manner. To explore this idea, we first propose a method called Vision-Guided Location Search (VGLS), which evaluates whether a general-purpose VLM is capable of trajectory-based reasoning without modifying any of its internal parameters. Based on insights from the VGLS results, we further propose our main approach: VLMLocPredictor, which is composed of two stages: In the first stage, we design two Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) tasks that help the VLM understand road network and trajectory structures and acquire basic reasoning ability on such visual inputs. In the second stage, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Visual Map Feedback, enabling the model to self-improve its next-location prediction ability through interaction with the environment. Experiments conducted on datasets from four different cities show that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and exhibits superior cross-city generalization compared to other LLM-based approaches."

While traditional models like CNNs and RNNs have achieved moderate success, they often struggle to generalize across diverse and complex actions. Recent advancements in vision-language models, especially the transformer-based CLIP model, offer promising capabilities for generalizing action recognition from video data. In this work, we evaluate CLIP on the UCF-101 dataset and systematically analyze its performance under three masking strategies: (1) percentage-based and shape-based black masking at 10%, 30%, and 50%, (2) feature-specific masking to suppress bias-inducing elements, and (3) isolation masking that retains only class-specific regions. Our results reveal that CLIP exhibits inconsistent behavior and frequent misclassifications, particularly when essential visual cues are obscured. To overcome these limitations, we propose incorporating class-specific noise, learned via a custom loss function, to reinforce attention to class-defining features. This enhancement improves classification accuracy and model confidence while reducing bias. We conclude with a discussion on the challenges of applying such models in clinical domains and outline directions for future work to improve generalizability across domain-independent healthcare scenarios."

However, estimating the unloaded geometry from clinical images remains a challenging task. Traditional approaches rely on inverse finite element (FE) solvers that require iterative optimization and are computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce HeartUnloadNet, a deep learning framework that predicts the unloaded left ventricular (LV) shape directly from the end diastolic (ED) mesh while explicitly incorporating biophysical priors. The network accepts a mesh of arbitrary size along with physiological parameters such as ED pressure, myocardial stiffness scale, and fiber helix orientation, and outputs the corresponding unloaded mesh. It adopts a graph attention architecture and employs a cycle-consistency strategy to enable bidirectional (loading and unloading) prediction, allowing for partial self-supervision that improves accuracy and reduces the need for large training datasets. Trained and tested on 20,700 FE simulations across diverse LV geometries and physiological conditions, HeartUnloadNet achieves sub-millimeter accuracy, with an average DSC of 0.986 and HD of 0.083 cm, while reducing inference time to just 0.02 seconds per case, over 10^5 times faster and significantly more accurate than traditional inverse FE solvers. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the architecture. Notably, the cycle-consistent design enables the model to maintain a DSC of 97% even with as few as 200 training samples. This work thus presents a scalable and accurate surrogate for inverse FE solvers, supporting real-time clinical applications in the future."

Unlike the abundant 2D imagery, acquiring 3D data typically requires specialized sensors and laborious annotation. In this work, we present a scalable pipeline that converts single-view images into comprehensive, scale- and appearance-realistic 3D representations - including point clouds, camera poses, depth maps, and pseudo-RGBD - via integrated depth estimation, camera calibration, and scale calibration. Our method bridges the gap between the vast repository of imagery and the increasing demand for spatial scene understanding. By automatically generating authentic, scale-aware 3D data from images, we significantly reduce data collection costs and open new avenues for advancing spatial intelligence. We release two generated spatial datasets, i.e., COCO-3D and Objects365-v2-3D, and demonstrate through extensive experiments that our generated data can benefit various 3D tasks, ranging from fundamental perception to MLLM-based reasoning. These results validate our pipeline as an effective solution for developing AI systems capable of perceiving, understanding, and interacting with physical environments."

Market makers (MMs) play a fundamental role in providing liquidity, yet face significant challenges arising from inventory risk, competition, and non-stationary market dynamics. This research explores how RL, particularly Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), can be employed to develop autonomous, adaptive, and profitable market making strategies.\n  The study begins by formulating the MM task as a reinforcement learning problem, designing agents capable of operating in both single-agent and multi-agent settings within a simulated financial environment. It then addresses the complex issue of inventory management using two complementary approaches: reward engineering and Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL). While the former uses dynamic reward shaping to guide behavior, the latter leverages Pareto front optimization to explicitly balance competing objectives.\n  To address the problem of non-stationarity, the research introduces POW-dTS, a novel policy weighting algorithm based on Discounted Thompson Sampling. This method allows agents to dynamically select and combine pretrained policies, enabling continual adaptation to shifting market conditions.\n  The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RL-based approaches significantly outperform traditional and baseline algorithmic strategies across various performance metrics. Overall, this research thesis contributes new methodologies and insights for the design of robust, efficient, and adaptive market making agents, reinforcing the potential of RL to transform algorithmic trading in complex financial systems."

However, the performance of these probes is highly dependent on the internal representations they probe from, making identifying the appropriate layer to probe an essential task. In this paper, we propose a method to automatically identify which layer's representations in a neural network model should be considered when probing for a given human-defined concept of interest, based on how informative and regular the representations are with respect to the concept.

Neural radiance field (NeRF)-based methods that reconstruct sensor observations via ray-casting of implicit representations have demonstrated accurate simulation of driving scenes, but are slow to train and render, hampering scale. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated faster training and rendering times through rasterization, but is primarily restricted to pinhole camera sensors, preventing usage for realistic multi-sensor autonomy evaluation. Moreover, both NeRF and 3DGS couple the representation with the rendering procedure (implicit networks for ray-based evaluation, particles for rasterization), preventing interoperability, which is key for general usage. In this work, we present Sparse Local Fields (SaLF), a novel volumetric representation that supports rasterization and raytracing. SaLF represents volumes as a sparse set of 3D voxel primitives, where each voxel is a local implicit field. SaLF has fast training (<30 min) and rendering capabilities (50+ FPS for camera and 600+ FPS LiDAR), has adaptive pruning and densification to easily handle large scenes, and can support non-pinhole cameras and spinning LiDARs. We demonstrate that SaLF has similar realism as existing self-driving sensor simulation methods while improving efficiency and enhancing capabilities, enabling more scalable simulation. https://waabi.ai/salf/"

Despite the success of existing unlearning algorithms, unlearning in sparse models has not yet been well studied. In this paper, we empirically find that the deleted data has an impact on the pruned topology in a sparse model. Motivated by the observation and the right to be forgotten, we define a new terminology ``un-pruning\" to eliminate the impact of deleted data on model pruning. Then we propose an un-pruning algorithm to approximate the pruned topology driven by retained data. We remark that any existing unlearning algorithm can be integrated with the proposed un-pruning workflow and the error of un-pruning is upper-bounded in theory. Also, our un-pruning algorithm can be applied to both structured sparse models and unstructured sparse models. In the experiment, we further find that Membership Inference Attack (MIA) accuracy is unreliable for assessing whether a model has forgotten deleted data, as a small change in the amount of deleted data can produce arbitrary MIA results. Accordingly, we devise new performance metrics for sparse models to evaluate the success of un-pruning. Lastly, we conduct extensive experiments to verify the efficacy of un-pruning with various pruning methods and unlearning algorithms.

In this context, images are reconstructed from linearly compressed measurements. In practice, total variation minimisation is still used to reconstruct the image from noisy measurements of the inner product between orthogonal sampling pattern vectors and the original image data. However, data can be leveraged to learn the measurement vectors and the reconstruction process, thereby enhancing compression, reconstruction quality, and speed. We train an autoencoder through self-supervision to learn an encoder (or measurement matrix) and a decoder. We then test it on physically acquired multispectral and intensity data. During acquisition, the learned encoder becomes part of the physical device. Our approach can enhance single-pixel imaging in fluorescence microscopy by reducing reconstruction time by two orders of magnitude, achieving superior image quality, and enabling multispectral reconstructions. Ultimately, learned single-pixel fluorescence microscopy could advance diagnosis and biological research, providing multispectral imaging at a fraction of the cost."

We introduce Specification Self-Correction (SSC), a novel, test-time framework that enables an LM to identify and correct flaws within its own guiding specification. SSC employs a multi-step inference process where the model first generates a response based on a potentially tainted specification, critiques its output, and then revises the specification itself to remove the exploitable loophole. A final, more robust response is then generated using this self-corrected specification. Across experiments spanning creative writing and agentic coding tasks with several LMs, we demonstrate that while models initially game tainted specifications in 50-70\\% of cases, the SSC process reduces this vulnerability by over 90\\%. This dynamic repair occurs at inference time, requires no weight modification, and leads to more robustly aligned model behavior. Code at https://github.com/vicgalle/specification-self-correction ."

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, with its all-weather capability, is essential in remote sensing, yet the lack of large-scale, high-quality SAR image-text datasets hinders its semantic understanding. In this paper, we construct SAR-Text, a large-scale and high-quality dataset consisting of over 130,000 SAR image-text pairs. To construct the SAR-Text dataset, we design the SAR-Narrator framework, which generates textual descriptions for SAR images through a multi-stage progressive transfer learning strategy. To verify the effectiveness of the SAR-TEXT dataset, we conduct experiments on three typical vision-language tasks: image-text retrieval, image captioning, and visual question answering (VQA). Specifically, we construct three representative models on SAR-TEXT: SAR-RS-CLIP, SAR-RS-CoCa, and SAR-GPT. SAR-RS-CLIP achieves notable improvements in retrieval performance, boosting average recall by 16.43% and 10.54% on the OSdataset-512 and HRSID test sets, respectively. In the captioning task, SAR-RS-CoCa achieves BLEU-4, SPICE, and CIDEr scores exceeding those of the original CoCa model by more than 8x, 4x, and 10x, respectively. In the VQA task, SAR-GPT outperforms baseline and single-stage models on multiple SAR-VQA datasets, demonstrating stronger semantic understanding and reasoning ability, as further confirmed by qualitative results. It is worth noting that, as a flexible captioning tool, SAR-Narrator can be readily adopted by the community to construct larger-scale SAR image-text datasets."

To address this issue, CatchPhrase generates enriched cross-modal semantic prompts (EXPrompt Mining) from weak class labels by leveraging large language models (LLMs) and audio captioning models (ACMs). To address both class-level and instance-level misalignment, we apply multi-modal filtering and retrieval to select the most semantically aligned prompt for each audio sample (EXPrompt Selector).

A core aspect of MABs is the exploration-exploitation trade-off: choosing between exploiting items likely to be enjoyed and exploring new ones to gather information. In contextual linear bandits, this trade-off is particularly central, as many variants share the same linear regression backbone and differ primarily in their exploration strategies. Despite its prevalent use, offline evaluation of MABs is increasingly recognized for its limitations in reliably assessing exploration behavior. This study conducts an extensive offline empirical comparison of several linear MABs. Strikingly, across over 90% of various datasets, a greedy linear model, with no type of exploration, consistently achieves top-tier performance, often outperforming or matching its exploratory counterparts. This observation is further corroborated by hyperparameter optimization, which consistently favors configurations that minimize exploration, suggesting that pure exploitation is the dominant strategy within these evaluation settings. Our results expose significant inadequacies in offline evaluation protocols for bandits, particularly concerning their capacity to reflect true exploratory efficacy. Consequently, this research underscores the urgent necessity for developing more robust assessment methodologies, guiding future investigations into alternative evaluation frameworks for interactive learning in recommender systems."

However, these methods predict Gaussians for each frame independently, without fully capturing the relations of Gaussians from different timestamps. To address this, we propose Human Gaussian Graph to model the connection between predicted Gaussians and human SMPL mesh, so that we can leverage information from all frames to recover an animatable human representation. Specifically, the Human Gaussian Graph contains dual layers where Gaussians are the first layer nodes and mesh vertices serve as the second layer nodes. Based on this structure, we further propose the intra-node operation to aggregate various Gaussians connected to one mesh vertex, and inter-node operation to support message passing among mesh node neighbors. Experimental results on novel view synthesis and novel pose animation demonstrate the efficiency and generalization of our method."

We introduce the Arabic Script RoBERTa (AS-RoBERTa) family: four RoBERTa-based models, each pre-trained on a large corpus tailored to its specific language. By focusing pre-training on language-specific script features and statistics, our models capture patterns overlooked by general-purpose models.

Recent works have addressed the problem by representing the entire non-obstacle road regions as the free-space. In contrast our aim is to estimate the driving corridors that are a navigable subset of the entire road region. Unfortunately, existing corridor estimation methods directly assume a BEV-centric representation, which is hard to obtain. In contrast, we frame drivable free-space corridor prediction as a pure image perception task, using only monocular camera input. However such a formulation poses several challenges as one doesn't have the corresponding data for such free-space corridor segments in the image. Consequently, we develop a novel self-supervised approach for free-space sample generation by leveraging future ego trajectories and front-view camera images, making the process of visual corridor estimation dependent on the ego trajectory. We then employ a diffusion process to model the distribution of such segments in the image. However, the existing binary mask-based representation for a segment poses many limitations. Therefore, we introduce ContourDiff, a specialized diffusion-based architecture that denoises over contour points rather than relying on binary mask representations, enabling structured and interpretable free-space predictions. We evaluate our approach qualitatively and quantitatively on both nuScenes and CARLA, demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately predicting safe multimodal navigable corridors in the image."

We present a series of five models, beginning with Genesis and concluding with Nexus, an advanced model featuring an EfficientNetV2B3 backbone and a dynamic attention mechanism. Our experiments chart the impact of architectural enhancements and demonstrate a key finding within the classic CNN-LSTM paradigm: merely upgrading the visual backbone without a corresponding attention mechanism can degrade performance, as the single-vector bottleneck cannot transmit the richer visual detail. This insight validates the architectural shift to attention.

        "summary": "arXiv:2507.18794v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Learning representations unaffected by superficial characteristics is important to ensure that shifts in these characteristics at test time do not compromise downstream prediction performance. For instance, in healthcare applications, we might like to learn features that contain information about pathology yet are unaffected by race, sex, and other sources of physiologic variability, thereby ensuring predictions are equitable and generalizable across all demographics. Here we propose Contrastive LEarning with Anti-contrastive Regularization (CLEAR), an intuitive and easy-to-implement framework that effectively separates essential (i.e., task-relevant) characteristics from superficial (i.e., task-irrelevant) characteristics during training, leading to better performance when superficial characteristics shift at test time. We begin by supposing that data representations can be semantically separated into task-relevant content features, which contain information relevant to downstream tasks, and task-irrelevant style features, which encompass superficial attributes that are irrelevant to these tasks, yet may degrade performance due to associations with content present in training data that do not generalize. We then prove that our anti-contrastive penalty, which we call Pair-Switching (PS), minimizes the Mutual Information between the style attributes and content labels. Finally, we instantiate CLEAR in the latent space of a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE), then perform experiments to quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the resulting CLEAR-VAE over several image datasets. Our results show that CLEAR-VAE allows us to: (a) swap and interpolate content and style between any pair of samples, and (b) improve downstream classification performance in the presence of previously unseen combinations of content and style. Our code will be made publicly available."

While existing research on GNN robustness has primarily focused on software-level threats, hardware-induced faults and errors remain largely underexplored. As hardware systems progress toward advanced technology nodes to meet high-performance and energy efficiency demands, they become increasingly susceptible to transient faults, which can cause bit flips and silent data corruption, a prominent issue observed by major technology companies (e.g., Meta and Google). In response, we first present a comprehensive analysis of GNN robustness against bit-flip errors, aiming to reveal system-level optimization opportunities for future reliable and efficient GNN systems. Second, we propose Ralts, a generalizable and lightweight solution to bolster GNN resilience to bit-flip errors. Specifically, Ralts exploits various graph similarity metrics to filter out outliers and recover compromised graph topology, and incorporates these protective techniques directly into aggregation functions to support any message-passing GNNs. Evaluation results demonstrate that Ralts effectively enhances GNN robustness across a range of GNN models, graph datasets, error patterns, and both dense and sparse architectures. On average, under a BER of $3\\times10^{-5}$, these robust aggregation functions improve prediction accuracy by at least 20\\% when errors present in model weights or node embeddings, and by at least 10\\% when errors occur in adjacency matrices. Ralts is also optimized to deliver execution efficiency comparable to built-in aggregation functions in PyTorch Geometric."

Typically, the Fisher diagonal is estimated via squared sampled gradients of the model's likelihood with respect to its parameters, averaged over a few hundred or thousand examples -- a process which incurs nontrivial computational costs. At the same time, adaptive gradient methods like the ubiquitous Adam optimizer compute a moving average of the squared gradient over the course of training. This paper therefore explores whether an approximation of the Fisher diagonal can be obtained \"for free\" by recycling the squared gradient accumulator that has already been computed over the course of training. Through a comprehensive set of experiments covering five applications of the Fisher diagonal, we demonstrate that the \"Squisher\" (SQUared gradient accumulator as an approximation of the FISHER) consistently performs similarly to the Fisher diagonal while outperforming baseline methods. Additionally, we clarify the exact differences between the Squisher and the Fisher diagonal and provide empirical quantification of their respective impact."

There are strong parallels between this widespread framework and offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning algorithms: a universal value function is trained on a large number of goals, and the policy is evaluated on a single goal in each test episode. Extensive research in foundation models has shown that performance can be substantially improved through test-time training, specializing the model to the current goal. We find similarly that test-time offline reinforcement learning on experience related to the test goal can lead to substantially better policies at minimal compute costs. We propose a novel self-supervised data selection criterion, which selects transitions from an offline dataset according to their relevance to the current state and quality with respect to the evaluation goal. We demonstrate across a wide range of high-dimensional loco-navigation and manipulation tasks that fine-tuning a policy on the selected data for a few gradient steps leads to significant performance gains over standard offline pre-training. Our goal-conditioned test-time training (GC-TTT) algorithm applies this routine in a receding-horizon fashion during evaluation, adapting the policy to the current trajectory as it is being rolled out. Finally, we study compute allocation at inference, demonstrating that, at comparable costs, GC-TTT induces performance gains that are not achievable by scaling model size."

Previous ML models typically cannot generalize outside the training data; for example, a trained ML model for the Navier-Stokes equations only works for a fixed Reynolds number ($Re$) on a pre-defined domain. To overcome these limitations, we propose a data augmentation scheme based on scale-consistency properties of PDEs and design a scale-informed neural operator that can model a wide range of scales. Our formulation leverages the facts: (i) PDEs can be rescaled, or more concretely, a given domain can be re-scaled to unit size, and the parameters and the boundary conditions of the PDE can be appropriately adjusted to represent the original solution, and (ii) the solution operators on a given domain are consistent on the sub-domains. We leverage these facts to create a scale-consistency loss that encourages matching the solutions evaluated on a given domain and the solution obtained on its sub-domain from the rescaled PDE. Since neural operators can fit to multiple scales and resolutions, they are the natural choice for incorporating scale-consistency loss during training of neural PDE solvers. We experiment with scale-consistency loss and the scale-informed neural operator model on the Burgers' equation, Darcy Flow, Helmholtz equation, and Navier-Stokes equations. With scale-consistency, the model trained on $Re$ of 1000 can generalize to $Re$ ranging from 250 to 10000, and reduces the error by 34% on average of all datasets compared to baselines."

Videos and images generated by artificial intelligence (AI) have become increasingly more difficult to differentiate from genuine media, resulting in the need for new models to detect artificially-generated media. While many models have attempted to solve this, most focus on direct image processing, adapting a convolutional neural network (CNN) or a recurrent neural network (RNN) that directly interacts with the video image data. This paper introduces an approach of using solely facial landmarks for deepfake detection. Using a dataset consisting of both deepfake and genuine videos of human faces, this paper describes an approach for extracting facial landmarks for deepfake detection, focusing on identifying subtle inconsistencies in facial movements instead of raw image processing. Experimental results demonstrated that this feature extraction technique is effective in various neural network models, with the same facial landmarks tested on three neural network models, with promising performance metrics indicating its potential for real-world applications. The findings discussed in this paper include RNN and artificial neural network (ANN) models with accuracy between 96% and 93%, respectively, with a CNN model hovering around 78%. This research challenges the assumption that raw image processing is necessary to identify deepfake videos by presenting a facial feature extraction approach compatible with various neural network models while requiring fewer parameters."

This work formulates the realism enhancing and detail adding process as image-to-image diffusion models, which refines the quality of LDM-generated images. We employ commonly used metrics like FID and LPIPS for image realism assessment.

Motivated by the human learning process, we propose to generalize not only success knowledge but also failure experience so that the strong model can learn from failed trajectories accumulated by weak models. To effectively and efficiently elicit the potential of strong agents, we further construct ``trajectory trees,\" a hierarchical representation that organizes weak model-generated action trajectories, coupled with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to optimize the strong model.

This task is notably challenging due to the absence of auditory cues and the visual ambiguity of phonemes that exhibit similar visemes-distinct sounds that appear identical in lip motions. Existing methods often aim to predict words or characters directly from visual cues, but they commonly suffer from high error rates due to viseme ambiguity and require large amounts of pre-training data. We propose a novel phoneme-based two-stage framework that fuses visual and landmark motion features, followed by an LLM model for word reconstruction to address these challenges. Stage 1 consists of V-ASR, which outputs the predicted phonemes, thereby reducing training complexity. Meanwhile, the facial landmark features address speaker-specific facial characteristics. Stage 2 comprises an encoder-decoder LLM model, NLLB, that reconstructs the output phonemes back to words. Besides using a large visual dataset for deep learning fine-tuning, our PV-ASR method demonstrates superior performance by achieving 17.4% WER on the LRS2 and 21.0% WER on the LRS3 dataset."

Early identification of high-risk individuals is crucial for clinical decision-making. Methods: We developed a machine learning framework to predict 30-day in-hospital mortality among ICU patients with HKD using early clinical data from the MIMIC-IV v2.2 database. A cohort of 1,366 adults was curated with strict criteria, excluding malignancy cases. Eighteen clinical features-including vital signs, labs, comorbidities, and therapies-were selected via random forest importance and mutual information filtering. Several models were trained and compared with stratified five-fold cross-validation; CatBoost demonstrated the best performance. Results: CatBoost achieved an AUROC of 0.88 on the independent test set, with sensitivity of 0.811 and specificity of 0.798. SHAP values and Accumulated Local Effects (ALE) plots showed the model relied on meaningful predictors such as altered consciousness, vasopressor use, and coagulation status. Additionally, the DREAM algorithm was integrated to estimate patient-specific posterior risk distributions, allowing clinicians to assess both predicted mortality and its uncertainty. Conclusions: We present an interpretable machine learning pipeline for early, real-time risk assessment in ICU patients with HKD. By combining high predictive performance with uncertainty quantification, our model supports individualized triage and transparent clinical decisions.

However, individual rewards generally rely on manually engineered shaping-reward functions that lack high-order intelligence, thus it behaves ineffectively than humans regarding learning and generalization in complex problems. To tackle these issues, we combine the above two paradigms and propose a novel framework, LIGHT (Learning Individual Intrinsic reward via Incorporating Generalized Human experTise), which can integrate human knowledge into MARL algorithms in an end-to-end manner. LIGHT guides each agent to avoid unnecessary exploration by considering both individual action distribution and human expertise preference distribution. Then, LIGHT designs individual intrinsic rewards for each agent based on actionable representational transformation relevant to Q-learning so that the agents align their action preferences with the human expertise while maximizing the joint action value. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over representative baselines regarding performance and better knowledge reusability across different sparse-reward tasks on challenging scenarios."

In this paper, we propose MAT-Adv, a novel adversarial attack framework that enhances both transferability and undefendability by explicitly perturbing the medial axis transform (MAT) representations, in order to induce inherent adversarialness in the resulting point clouds. Specifically, we employ an autoencoder to project input point clouds into compact MAT representations that capture the intrinsic geometric structure of point clouds. By perturbing these intrinsic representations, MAT-Adv introduces structural-level adversarial characteristics that remain effective across diverse models and defense strategies. To mitigate overfitting and prevent perturbation collapse, we incorporate a dropout strategy into the optimization of MAT perturbations, further improving transferability and undefendability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAT-Adv significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both transferability and undefendability.

        "summary": "arXiv:2507.18881v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Since a building's floorplans are easily accessible, consistent over time, and inherently robust to changes in visual appearance, self-localization within the floorplan has attracted researchers' interest. However, since floorplans are minimalist representations of a building's structure, modal and geometric differences between visual perceptions and floorplans pose challenges to this task. While existing methods cleverly utilize 2D geometric features and pose filters to achieve promising performance, they fail to address the localization errors caused by frequent visual changes and view occlusions due to variously shaped 3D objects. To tackle these issues, this paper views the 2D Floorplan Localization (FLoc) problem from a higher dimension by injecting 3D geometric priors into the visual FLoc algorithm. For the 3D geometric prior modeling, we first model geometrically aware view invariance using multi-view constraints, i.e., leveraging imaging geometric principles to provide matching constraints between multiple images that see the same points. Then, we further model the view-scene aligned geometric priors, enhancing the cross-modal geometry-color correspondences by associating the scene's surface reconstruction with the RGB frames of the sequence. Both 3D priors are modeled through self-supervised contrastive learning, thus no additional geometric or semantic annotations are required. These 3D priors summarized in extensive realistic scenes bridge the modal gap while improving localization success without increasing the computational burden on the FLoc algorithm. Sufficient comparative studies demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods and substantially boosts the FLoc accuracy. All data and code will be released after the anonymous review."

Many approaches crowdsource this data from a large number of annotators with varying skills, backgrounds, and motivations, resulting in conflicting annotations. These conflicts have traditionally been resolved by aggregation methods that assume disagreements are errors. Recent work has argued that for many tasks annotators may have genuine disagreements and that variation should be treated as signal rather than noise. However, few models separate signal and noise in annotator disagreement. In this work, we introduce NUTMEG, a new Bayesian model that incorporates information about annotator backgrounds to remove noisy annotations from human-labeled training data while preserving systematic disagreements. Using synthetic data, we show that NUTMEG is more effective at recovering ground-truth from annotations with systematic disagreement than traditional aggregation methods. We provide further analysis characterizing how differences in subpopulation sizes, rates of disagreement, and rates of spam affect the performance of our model. Finally, we demonstrate that downstream models trained on NUTMEG-aggregated data significantly outperform models trained on data from traditionally aggregation methods. Our results highlight the importance of accounting for both annotator competence and systematic disagreements when training on human-labeled data."

Image-guided brachytherapy planning requires amongst others, the reconstruction of the needles. Manually annotating these needles on patient images can be a challenging and time-consuming task for medical professionals. For automatic needle reconstruction, a two-stage pipeline is commonly adopted, comprising a segmentation stage followed by a post-processing stage. While deep learning models are effective for segmentation, their results often contain errors. No currently existing post-processing technique is robust to all possible segmentation errors. We therefore propose adaptations to existing post-processing techniques mainly aimed at dealing with segmentation errors and thereby improving the reconstruction accuracy. Experiments on a prostate cancer dataset, based on MRI scans annotated by medical professionals, demonstrate that our proposed adaptations can help to effectively manage segmentation errors, with the best adapted post-processing technique achieving median needle-tip and needle-bottom point localization errors of $1.07$ (IQR $\\pm 1.04$) mm and $0.43$ (IQR $\\pm 0.46$) mm, respectively, and median shaft error of $0.75$ (IQR $\\pm 0.69$) mm with 0 false positive and 0 false negative needles on a test set of 261 needles."

The agents are tasked with assessing the reproducibility of the paper based on the original paper PDF and the corresponding reproduction package. REPRO-Bench features end-to-end evaluation tasks on the reproducibility of social science papers with complexity comparable to real-world assessments. We evaluate three representative AI agents on REPRO-Bench, with the best-performing agent achieving an accuracy of only 21.4%. Building on our empirical analysis, we develop REPRO-Agent, which improves the highest accuracy achieved by existing agents by 71%.

Dictionary-based prompting methods can enhance translation on them, but most methods use all the available dictionaries, which could be expensive. Instead, it will be flexible to have a trade-off between token consumption and translation performance. This paper proposes a novel task called \\textbf{A}utomatic \\textbf{D}ictionary \\textbf{S}election (\\textbf{ADS}). The goal of the task is to automatically select which dictionary to use to enhance translation. We propose a novel and effective method which we call \\textbf{S}elect \\textbf{Lo}w-frequency \\textbf{W}ords! (\\textbf{SLoW}) which selects those dictionaries that have a lower frequency. Our methods have unique advantages. First, there is no need for access to the training data for frequency estimation (which is usually unavailable). Second, it inherits the advantage of dictionary-based methods, where no additional tuning is required on LLMs. Experimental results on 100 languages from FLORES indicate that SLoW surpasses strong baselines, and it can obviously save token usage, with many languages even surpassing the translation performance of the full dictionary baseline.\\footnote{A shocking fact is that there is no need to use the actual training data (often unobtainable) for frequency estimation, and an estimation frequency obtained using public resources is still apparently effective in improving translation with ChatGPT and Llama, and DeepSeek.}\\footnote{Code and data available upon publication.}"

In particular, for certain specialized categories, the available image dataset is insufficiently populated. Synthetic datasets can be utilized to alleviate the problem of limited data to some extent. However, directly training with synthetic datasets compared to real datasets can lead to a degradation in model performance. To tackle this problem, in this work, we investigate a new task, namely Syn-to-Real Camouflaged Object Detection (S2R-COD). In order to improve the model performance in real world scenarios, a set of annotated synthetic camouflaged images and a limited number of unannotated real images must be utilized. We propose the Cycling Syn-to-Real Domain Adaptation Framework (CSRDA), a method based on the student-teacher model. Specially, CSRDA propagates class information from the labeled source domain to the unlabeled target domain through pseudo labeling combined with consistency regularization. Considering that narrowing the intra-domain gap can improve the quality of pseudo labeling, CSRDA utilizes a recurrent learning framework to build an evolving real domain for bridging the source and target domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, mitigating the problem of limited data and handcraft annotations in COD.

In this paper, we introduce HQ-SMem, for High Quality video segmentation and tracking using Smart Memory, a novel method that enhances the performance of VOS base models by addressing these limitations. Our approach incorporates three key innovations: (i) leveraging SAM with High-Quality masks (SAM-HQ) alongside appearance-based candidate-selection to refine coarse segmentation masks, resulting in improved object boundaries; (ii) implementing a dynamic smart memory mechanism that selectively stores relevant key frames while discarding redundant ones, thereby optimizing memory usage and processing efficiency for long-term videos; and (iii) dynamically updating the appearance model to effectively handle complex topological object variations and reduce drift throughout the video. These contributions mitigate several limitations of existing VOS models including, coarse segmentations that mix-in background pixels, fixed memory update schedules, brittleness to drift and occlusions, and prompt ambiguity issues associated with SAM. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple public datasets and state-of-the-art base trackers demonstrate that our method consistently ranks among the top two on VOTS and VOTSt 2024 datasets.

This results in unevenly distributed Gaussians that deviate from the latent surface, complicating both reconstruction refinement and scene editing. Motivated by pioneering work on Point Set Surfaces, we propose Gaussian Set Surface Reconstruction (GSSR), a method designed to distribute Gaussians evenly along the latent surface while aligning their dominant normals with the surface normal. GSSR enforces fine-grained geometric alignment through a combination of pixel-level and Gaussian-level single-view normal consistency and multi-view photometric consistency, optimizing both local and global perspectives. To further refine the representation, we introduce an opacity regularization loss to eliminate redundant Gaussians and apply periodic depth- and normal-guided Gaussian reinitialization for a cleaner, more uniform spatial distribution. Our reconstruction results demonstrate significantly improved geometric precision in Gaussian placement, enabling intuitive scene editing and efficient generation of novel Gaussian-based 3D environments.

This paper introduces the geometric multi-color message-passing graph neural network (GMC-MPNN), a novel framework that enhances standard message-passing architectures by explicitly incorporating atomic-level geometric features and long-range interactions. Our model constructs weighted colored subgraphs based on atom types to capture the spatial relationships and chemical context that govern BBB permeability. We evaluated GMC-MPNN on three benchmark datasets for both classification and regression tasks, using rigorous scaffold-based splitting to ensure a robust assessment of generalization. The results demonstrate that GMC-MPNN consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, achieving superior performance in both classifying compounds as permeable/non-permeable (AUC-ROC of 0.9704 and 0.9685) and in regressing continuous permeability values (RMSE of 0.4609, Pearson correlation of 0.7759). An ablation study further quantified the impact of specific atom-pair interactions, revealing that the model's predictive power derives from its ability to learn from both common and rare, but chemically significant, functional motifs. By integrating spatial geometry into the graph representation, GMC-MPNN sets a new performance benchmark and offers a more accurate and generalizable tool for drug discovery pipelines."

To address this, we propose a novel multi-granularity hierarchical fusion transformer (MGHFT), with a multi-view sticker interpreter based on Multimodal Large Language Models. Specifically, inspired by the human ability to interpret sticker emotions from multiple views, we first use Multimodal Large Language Models to interpret stickers by providing rich textual context via multi-view descriptions. Then, we design a hierarchical fusion strategy to fuse the textual context into visual understanding, which builds upon a pyramid visual transformer to extract both global and local sticker features at multiple stages. Through contrastive learning and attention mechanisms, textual features are injected at different stages of the visual backbone, enhancing the fusion of global- and local-granularity visual semantics with textual guidance. Finally, we introduce a text-guided fusion attention mechanism to effectively integrate the overall multimodal features, enhancing semantic understanding. Extensive experiments on 2 public sticker emotion datasets demonstrate that MGHFT significantly outperforms existing sticker emotion recognition approaches, achieving higher accuracy and more fine-grained emotion recognition. Compared to the best pre-trained visual models, our MGHFT also obtains an obvious improvement, 5.4% on F1 and 4.0% on accuracy. The code is released at https://github.com/cccccj-03/MGHFT_ACMMM2025."

        "summary": "arXiv:2507.18932v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) reports are essential for evaluating sustainability practices, ensuring regulatory compliance, and promoting financial transparency. However, these documents are often lengthy, structurally diverse, and multimodal, comprising dense text, structured tables, complex figures, and layout-dependent semantics. Existing AI systems often struggle to perform reliable document-level reasoning in such settings, and no dedicated benchmark currently exists in ESG domain. To fill the gap, we introduce \\textbf{MMESGBench}, a first-of-its-kind benchmark dataset targeted to evaluate multimodal understanding and complex reasoning across structurally diverse and multi-source ESG documents. This dataset is constructed via a human-AI collaborative, multi-stage pipeline. First, a multimodal LLM generates candidate question-answer (QA) pairs by jointly interpreting rich textual, tabular, and visual information from layout-aware document pages. Second, an LLM verifies the semantic accuracy, completeness, and reasoning complexity of each QA pair. This automated process is followed by an expert-in-the-loop validation, where domain specialists validate and calibrate QA pairs to ensure quality, relevance, and diversity. MMESGBench comprises 933 validated QA pairs derived from 45 ESG documents, spanning across seven distinct document types and three major ESG source categories. Questions are categorized as single-page, cross-page, or unanswerable, with each accompanied by fine-grained multimodal evidence. Initial experiments validate that multimodal and retrieval-augmented models substantially outperform text-only baselines, particularly on visually grounded and cross-page tasks. MMESGBench is publicly available as an open-source dataset at https://github.com/Zhanglei1103/MMESGBench."

Most point cloud learning and processing methods typically leverage the unordered and unconstrained nature to represent the underlying geometry of 3D shapes. However, how to extract meaningful structural information from unstructured point cloud distributions and transform them into semantically meaningful point distributions remains an under-explored problem. We present PDT, a novel framework for point distribution transformation with diffusion models. Given a set of input points, PDT learns to transform the point set from its original geometric distribution into a target distribution that is semantically meaningful. Our method utilizes diffusion models with novel architecture and learning strategy, which effectively correlates the source and the target distribution through a denoising process. Through extensive experiments, we show that our method successfully transforms input point clouds into various forms of structured outputs - ranging from surface-aligned keypoints, and inner sparse joints to continuous feature lines. The results showcase our framework's ability to capture both geometric and semantic features, offering a powerful tool for various 3D geometry processing tasks where structured point distributions are desired.

To address this, we propose LLaVA-NeuMT, a novel multimodal multilingual translation framework that explicitly models language-specific and language-agnostic representations to mitigate multilingual interference. Our approach consists of a layer selection mechanism that identifies the most informative layers for different language pairs and a neuron-level adaptation strategy that dynamically selects language-specific and agnostic neurons to improve translation quality while reducing redundancy. We conduct extensive experiments on the M3-Multi30K and M3-AmbigCaps datasets, demonstrating that LLaVA-NeuMT, while fine-tuning only 40\\% of the model parameters, surpasses full fine-tuning approaches and ultimately achieves SOTA results on both datasets. Our analysis further provides insights into the importance of selected layers and neurons in multimodal multilingual adaptation, offering an efficient and scalable solution to cross-lingual adaptation in multimodal translation."

To address this issue, we release a large-scale panoramic radiograph benchmark called \"PerioXrays\", comprising 3,673 images and 5,662 meticulously annotated instances of apical periodontitis.

This paper further proposes a clinical-oriented apical periodontitis detection (PerioDet) paradigm, which jointly incorporates Background-Denoising Attention (BDA) and IoU-Dynamic Calibration (IDC) mechanisms to address the challenges posed by background noise and small targets in automated detection. Extensive experiments on the PerioXrays dataset demonstrate the superiority of PerioDet in advancing automated apical periodontitis detection.

This dataset was collected under challenging and unconstrained conditions by NSW Police Highway Patrol Vehicles. A multi-view inference (MVI) approach was deployed to enhance the performance of the models' predictions. To conduct the analyses, datasets with 100,000 plus images were created for each of the three metadata prediction tasks, specifically make, shape and colour. The models were tested on a separate dataset with 29,937 images belonging to 1809 number plates. Different sets of experiments have been investigated by varying the models sizes. A classification accuracy of 93.70%, 82.86%, 85.19%, and 94.86% was achieved with the best performing make, shape, colour, and colour-binary models respectively. It was concluded that there is a need to use MVI to get usable models within such complex real-world datasets. Our findings indicated that the object detection models YOLO-v11 and YOLO-World outperformed classification-only models in make and shape extraction. Moreover, smaller YOLO variants perform comparably to larger counterparts, offering substantial efficiency benefits for real-time predictions. This work provides a robust baseline for extracting vehicle metadata in real-world scenarios.

Prior tool-augmented approaches typically finetune an LLM to select and invoke a single tool at each reasoning step and show promising results on simpler math reasoning benchmarks such as GSM8K. However, these approaches struggle with more complex math problems that require precise reasoning over multiple steps. To address this limitation, in this work, we propose Multi-TAG, a Multi-Tool AGgregation-based framework. Instead of relying on a single tool, Multi-TAG guides an LLM to concurrently invoke multiple tools at each reasoning step. It then aggregates their diverse outputs to verify and refine the reasoning process, enhancing solution robustness and accuracy. Notably, Multi-TAG is a finetuning-free, inference-only framework, making it readily applicable to any LLM backbone, including large open-weight models which are computationally expensive to finetune and proprietary frontier models which cannot be finetuned with custom recipes. We evaluate Multi-TAG on four challenging benchmarks: MATH500, AIME, AMC, and OlympiadBench. Across both open-weight and closed-source LLM backbones, Multi-TAG consistently and substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average improvements of 6.0% to 7.5% over state-of-the-art baselines."

Reconstruction-based attribution methods offer a promising solution, but they often suffer from reduced accuracy and high computational costs when applied to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. To address these challenges, we propose AEDR (AutoEncoder Double-Reconstruction), a novel training-free attribution method designed for generative models with continuous autoencoders. Unlike existing reconstruction-based approaches that rely on the value of a single reconstruction loss, AEDR performs two consecutive reconstructions using the model's autoencoder, and adopts the ratio of these two reconstruction losses as the attribution signal. This signal is further calibrated using the image homogeneity metric to improve accuracy, which inherently cancels out absolute biases caused by image complexity, with autoencoder-based reconstruction ensuring superior computational efficiency. Experiments on eight top latent diffusion models show that AEDR achieves 25.5% higher attribution accuracy than existing reconstruction-based methods, while requiring only 1% of the computational time."

In this paper, we introduce GENIAL, a machine learning-based framework for the automatic generation and optimization of arithmetic units, more specifically multipliers.\n  At the core of GENIAL is a Transformer-based surrogate model trained in two stages, involving self-supervised pretraining followed by supervised finetuning, to robustly forecast key hardware metrics such as power and area from abstracted design representations. By inverting the surrogate model, GENIAL efficiently searches for new operand encodings that directly minimize power consumption in arithmetic units for specific input data distributions. Extensive experiments on large datasets demonstrate that GENIAL is consistently more sample efficient than other methods, and converges faster towards optimized designs. This enables to deploy a high-effort logic synthesis optimization flow in the loop, improving the accuracy of the surrogate model. Notably, GENIAL automatically discovers encodings that achieve up to 18% switching activity savings within multipliers on representative AI workloads compared with the conventional two's complement. We also demonstrate the versatility of our approach by achieving significant improvements on Finite State Machines, highlighting GENIAL's applicability for a wide spectrum of logic functions.

This transformation enables any state-of-the-art constant-delay method to be directly extended to the random-delay environments without modifying the algorithmic structure or sacrificing performance.

FADE also generalizes naturally to federated learning by treating heterogeneous clients as temporally fragmented environments, enabling scalable and stable adaptation in decentralized settings. Theoretical analysis guarantees bounded regret and parameter consistency, while empirical results demonstrate FADE's robustness across modalities and shift intensities."

To this end, existing methods focus on enhancing point cloud quality by developing dedicated denoising and completion models. However, due to the isolation between the point cloud enhancement and downstream tasks, these methods fail to work in various real-world domains. In addition, the conflicting objectives between denoising and completing tasks further limit the ensemble paradigm to preserve critical geometric features. To tackle the above challenges, we propose a unified point-level prompting method that reformulates point cloud denoising and completion as a prompting mechanism, enabling robust analysis in a parameter-efficient manner. We start by introducing a Rectification Prompter to adapt to noisy points through the predicted rectification vector prompts, effectively filtering noise while preserving intricate geometric features essential for accurate analysis. Sequentially, we further incorporate a Completion Prompter to generate auxiliary point prompts based on the rectified point clouds, facilitating their robustness and adaptability. Finally, a Shape-Aware Unit module is exploited to efficiently unify and capture the filtered geometric features for the downstream point cloud analysis.Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the superiority and robustness of our method when handling noisy and incomplete point cloud data against existing state-of-the-art methods.

While State-Space Models like Mamba offer proficiency in modeling long-range dependencies for this task, their inherent 1D causal scanning mechanism fragments the global context of 2D images, hindering fine-detail restoration. To address this, we propose Global Phase and Spectral Prompt-guided Mamba (GPSMamba), a framework that synergizes architectural guidance with non-causal supervision. First, our Adaptive Semantic-Frequency State Space Module (ASF-SSM) injects a fused semantic-frequency prompt directly into the Mamba block, integrating non-local context to guide reconstruction. Then, a novel Thermal-Spectral Attention and Phase Consistency Loss provides explicit, non-causal supervision to enforce global structural and spectral fidelity. By combining these two innovations, our work presents a systematic strategy to mitigate the limitations of causal modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GPSMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating our approach as a powerful new paradigm for infrared image restoration.

To address this issue, we design a novel evaluation score, ICT (Image-Contained-Text) score, that achieves and surpasses the objectives of text-image alignment by assessing the degree to which images represent textual content. Building upon this foundation, we further train an HP (High-Preference) score model using solely the image modality to enhance image aesthetics and detail quality while maintaining text-image alignment.

Popular RL algorithms utilize multiple workers and can be modeled as a graph, where each node is the status of a worker and each edge represents dataflow between nodes. Owing to the heavy cross-node dependencies, the RL training system usually suffers from poor cluster scalability and low memory utilization. In this article, we introduce MindSpeed RL, an effective and efficient system for large-scale RL training. Unlike existing centralized methods, MindSpeed RL organizes the essential data dependencies in RL training, i.e., sample flow and resharding flow, from a distributed view. On the one hand, a distributed transfer dock strategy, which sets controllers and warehouses on the basis of the conventional replay buffer, is designed to release the dispatch overhead in the sample flow. A practical allgather--swap strategy is presented to eliminate redundant memory usage in resharding flow. In addition, MindSpeed RL further integrates numerous parallelization strategies and acceleration techniques for systematic optimization. Compared with existing state-of-the-art systems, comprehensive experiments on the RL training of popular Qwen2.5-Dense-7B/32B, Qwen3-MoE-30B, and DeepSeek-R1-MoE-671B show that MindSpeed RL increases the throughput by 1.42 ~ 3.97 times.

These methods bridge the gap between the expressive power of GNNs and the computational efficiency of MLPs, making them well-suited for resource-constrained environments. However, existing G2M methods are limited by their inability to flexibly adjust inference cost and accuracy dynamically, a critical requirement for real-world applications where computational resources and time constraints can vary significantly. To address this, we introduce a Progressive framework designed to offer flexible and on-demand trade-offs between inference cost and accuracy for GNN-to-MLP knowledge distillation (ProGMLP). ProGMLP employs a Progressive Training Structure (PTS), where multiple MLP students are trained in sequence, each building on the previous one. Furthermore, ProGMLP incorporates Progressive Knowledge Distillation (PKD) to iteratively refine the distillation process from GNNs to MLPs, and Progressive Mixup Augmentation (PMA) to enhance generalization by progressively generating harder mixed samples. Our approach is validated through comprehensive experiments on eight real-world graph datasets, demonstrating that ProGMLP maintains high accuracy while dynamically adapting to varying runtime scenarios, making it highly effective for deployment in diverse application settings."

We apply our approach to a predator-prey system that features both local and global bifurcations, presenting a challenging test case. Our results show that Neural Ordinary Differential Equations can recover underlying bifurcation structures directly from timeseries data by learning parameter-dependent vector fields. Notably, we demonstrate that Neural Ordinary Differential Equations can forecast bifurcations even beyond the parameter regions represented in the training data.

However, existing generative model-based OSFL methods suffer from low training efficiency and potential privacy leakage in the healthcare domain. Additionally, achieving convergence within a single round of model aggregation is challenging under non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data. To address these challenges, in this paper a modified OSFL framework is proposed, in which a new Feature-Guided Rectified Flow Model (FG-RF) and Dual-Layer Knowledge Distillation (DLKD) aggregation method are developed. FG-RF on the client side accelerates generative modeling in medical imaging scenarios while preserving privacy by synthesizing feature-level images rather than pixel-level images. To handle non-IID distributions, DLKD enables the global student model to simultaneously mimic the output logits and align the intermediate-layer features of client-side teacher models during aggregation. Experimental results on three non-IID medical imaging datasets show that our new framework and method outperform multi-round federated learning approaches, achieving up to 21.73% improvement, and exceeds the baseline FedISCA by an average of 21.75%. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate that feature-level synthetic images significantly reduce privacy leakage risks compared to pixel-level synthetic images."

Reservoir computing (RC) offers a computationally efficient alternative to traditional deep learning by training only the read-out layer while employing a randomly structured and fixed reservoir network. Despite its advantages, the largely random reservoir graph architecture often results in suboptimal and oversized networks with poorly understood dynamics. Addressing this issue, we propose a novel Dynamics-Informed Reservoir Computing (DyRC) framework that systematically infers the reservoir network structure directly from the input training sequence. This work proposes to employ the visibility graph (VG) technique, which converts time series data into networks by representing measurement points as nodes linked by mutual visibility. The reservoir network is constructed by directly adopting the VG network from a training data sequence, leveraging the parameter-free visibility graph approach to avoid expensive hyperparameter tuning. This process results in a reservoir that is directly informed by the specific dynamics of the prediction task under study. We assess the DyRC-VG method through prediction tasks involving the canonical nonlinear Duffing oscillator, evaluating prediction accuracy and consistency.

In this work, we developed brain encoding models using state-of-the-art visual (X-CLIP) and auditory (Whisper) feature extractors and rigorously evaluated them on both in-distribution (ID) and diverse out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Our results reveal a fundamental trade-off between model complexity and generalization: a higher-capacity attention-based model excelled on ID data, but a simpler linear model was more robust, outperforming a competitive baseline by 18\\% on the OOD set. Intriguingly, we found that linguistic features did not improve predictive accuracy, suggesting that for familiar languages, neural encoding may be dominated by the continuous visual and auditory streams over redundant textual information. Spatially, our approach showed marked performance gains in the auditory cortex, underscoring the benefit of high-fidelity speech representations. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that rigorous OOD testing is essential for building robust neuro-AI models and provides nuanced insights into how model architecture, stimulus characteristics, and sensory hierarchies shape the neural encoding of our rich, multimodal world."

As mass spectrometers will be central to upcoming Solar System missions, predicting molecular assembly from their data without needing to elucidate unknown structures will be essential for unbiased life detection. An ideal agnostic biosignature must be interpretable and experimentally measurable. Here, we show that molecular assembly, a recently developed approach to measure objects that have been produced by evolution, satisfies both criteria. First, it is interpretable for life detection, as it reflects the assembly of molecules with their bonds as building blocks, in contrast to approaches that discount construction history. Second, it can be determined without structural elucidation, as it can be physically measured by mass spectrometry, a property that distinguishes it from other approaches that use structure-based information measures for molecular complexity. Whilst molecular assembly is directly measurable using mass spectrometry data, there are limits imposed by mission constraints. To address this, we developed a machine learning model that predicts molecular assembly with high accuracy, reducing error by three-fold compared to baseline models. Simulated data shows that even small instrumental inconsistencies can double model error, emphasizing the need for standardization. These results suggest that standardized mass spectrometry databases could enable accurate molecular assembly prediction, without structural elucidation, providing a proof-of-concept for future astrobiology missions."

To be specific, we introduce a hierarchical graph structure dubbed SceneConceptGraph to construct relations among multi-level scene concepts, which directs the outpainter for consistent novel views and can be dynamically refined to enhance diversity.

In this paper, we propose a novel Noise-Resilient Query Optimization (NRQO) paradigm, which innovatively incorporates the Noise-Tolerance Feature Pyramid Network (NT-FPN) and the Pairwise-Similarity Region Proposal Network (PS-RPN). Specifically, NT-FPN mitigates noise during feature fusion in FPN by preserving spatial and semantic information integrity. Unlike existing label assignment strategies, PS-RPN generates a sufficient number of high-quality positive queries by enhancing anchor-ground truth matching through position and shape similarities, without the need for additional hyperparameters. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks consistently demonstrate the superiority of NRQO over state-of-the-art baselines."

Specifically, many real-world applications require models to explicitly identify what is false or non-existent, \\eg, radiologists may search for images that exclude specific conditions. Despite the impressive transferability of VLMs through large-scale training, they suffer from a critical limitation that fails to handle negation. To address this challenge, existing methods attribute its root cause to the scarcity of negation training data and propose to fine-tune VLMs on massive data containing explicit negation. Undoubtedly, such data-centric solutions demand substantial data and computational resources, limiting their sustainable widespread adoption. To tackle negation in a low-carbon manner, we empirically observe that the key obstacle lies in the dual-concept shifts between the affirmation and negation distributions. Therefore, we propose a Negation-Aware Test-Time Adaptation (NEAT) method to efficiently adjust distribution-related parameters during inference. In brief, NEAT can reduce distribution shift in consistent semantics while eliminating false distributional consistency in unrelated semantics. Extensive experiments on the various negation understanding tasks verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The code is available at https://github.com/hhc1997/NEAT."

Our approach unifies multiple subjects through a Subject Bias Modulation Module while leveraging bidirectional mapping to better capture data distributions for precise representation prediction. To further enhance fidelity when decoding representations into stimulus images, we introduce a Semantic Refinement Module to improve semantic representations and a Visual Coherence Module to mitigate the effects of inaccurate visual representations.

Objective: The aim of this study was to segment the pulmonary vasculature using a semi-supervised method. Methods: In this study, a self-training framework is proposed by leveraging a teacher-student model for the segmentation of pulmonary vessels. First, the high-quality annotations are acquired in the in-house data by an interactive way. Then, the model is trained in the semi-supervised way. A fully supervised model is trained on a small set of labeled CT images, yielding the teacher model. Following this, the teacher model is used to generate pseudo-labels for the unlabeled CT images, from which reliable ones are selected based on a certain strategy. The training of the student model involves these reliable pseudo-labels. This training process is iteratively repeated until an optimal performance is achieved. Results: Extensive experiments are performed on non-enhanced CT scans of 125 COPD patients. Quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that the proposed method, Semi2, significantly improves the precision of vessel segmentation by 2.3%, achieving a precision of 90.3%. Further, quantitative analysis is conducted in the pulmonary vessel of COPD, providing insights into the differences in the pulmonary vessel across different severity of the disease. Conclusion: The proposed method can not only improve the performance of pulmonary vascular segmentation, but can also be applied in COPD analysis.

The related models generally follow the two-step paradigm of imputation and refinement. However, most imputation approaches fail to capture class-relevant semantic information, leading to sub-optimal imputation for clustering. Moreover, existing refinement strategies optimize the learned embedding through graph reconstruction, while neglecting the fact that some attributes are uncorrelated with the graph. To remedy the problems, we establish the Clustering-oriented Generative Imputation with reliable Refinement (CGIR) model. Concretely, the subcluster distributions are estimated to reveal the class-specific characteristics precisely, and constrain the sampling space of the generative adversarial module, such that the imputation nodes are impelled to align with the correct clusters. Afterwards, multiple subclusters are merged to guide the proposed edge attention network, which identifies the edge-wise attributes for each class, so as to avoid the redundant attributes in graph reconstruction from disturbing the refinement of overall embedding. To sum up, CGIR splits attribute-missing graph clustering into the search and mergence of subclusters, which guides to implement node imputation and refinement within a unified framework. Extensive experiments prove the advantages of CGIR over state-of-the-art competitors."

We propose a Cross Spatial Temporal Fusion (CSTF) mechanism that enhances feature representation by integrating scale-invariant keypoints detected independently in both reference and query images. Our approach improves feature matching in two ways: First, by creating correspondence maps that leverage information from multiple image regions simultaneously, and second, by reformulating the similarity matching process as a classification task using SoftMax and Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) layers. This dual approach enables CSTF to maintain sensitivity to distinctive local features while incorporating broader contextual information, resulting in robust matching across diverse remote sensing modalities. To demonstrate the practical utility of improved feature matching, we evaluate CSTF on object detection tasks using the HRSC2016 and DOTA benchmark datasets. Our method achieves state-of-theart performance with an average mAP of 90.99% on HRSC2016 and 90.86% on DOTA, outperforming existing models.

For a given uniform-bit quantization configuration, MixA-Q separates the batched window computations within Swin blocks and assigns a lower bit width to the activations of less important windows, improving the trade-off between model performance and efficiency. We introduce a Two-Branch Swin Block that processes activations separately in high- and low-bit precision, enabling seamless integration of our method with most quantization-aware training (QAT) and post-training quantization (PTQ) methods, or with simple modifications. Our experimental evaluations over the COCO dataset demonstrate that MixA-Q achieves a training-free 1.35x computational speedup without accuracy loss in PTQ configuration. With QAT, MixA-Q achieves a lossless 1.25x speedup and a 1.53x speedup with only a 1% mAP drop by incorporating activation pruning. Notably, by reducing the quantization error in important regions, our sparsity-aware quantization adaptation improves the mAP of the quantized W4A4 model (with both weights and activations in 4-bit precision) by 0.7%, reducing quantization degradation by 24%."

Our analysis of two mainstream FSS paradigms reveals that the predictions made by prototype learning methods are usually conservative, while those of affinity learning methods tend to be more aggressive. This observation motivates us to balance the conservative and aggressive information captured by these two types of FSS frameworks so as to improve the segmentation performance. To achieve this, we propose a **P**rototype-**A**ffinity **H**ybrid **Net**work (PAHNet), which introduces a Prototype-guided Feature Enhancement (PFE) module and an Attention Score Calibration (ASC) module in each attention block of an affinity learning model (called affinity learner). These two modules utilize the predictions generated by a pre-trained prototype learning model (called prototype predictor) to enhance the foreground information in support and query image representations and suppress the mismatched foreground-background (FG-BG) relationships between them, respectively. In this way, the aggressiveness of the affinity learner can be effectively mitigated, thereby eventually increasing the segmentation accuracy of our PAHNet method. Experimental results show that PAHNet outperforms most recently proposed methods across 1-shot and 5-shot settings on both PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ datasets, suggesting its effectiveness.

Existing plane-based methods in dynamic Gaussian splatting suffer from an unsuitable low-rank assumption, causing feature overlap and poor rendering quality. Although 4D hash encoding provides an explicit representation without low-rank constraints, directly applying it to the entire dynamic scene leads to substantial hash collisions and redundancy. To address these challenges, we present DASH, a real-time dynamic scene rendering framework that employs 4D hash encoding coupled with self-supervised decomposition. Our approach begins with a self-supervised decomposition mechanism that separates dynamic and static components without manual annotations or precomputed masks. Next, we introduce a multiresolution 4D hash encoder for dynamic elements, providing an explicit representation that avoids the low-rank assumption. Finally, we present a spatio-temporal smoothness regularization strategy to mitigate unstable deformation artifacts. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that DASH achieves state-of-the-art dynamic rendering performance, exhibiting enhanced visual quality at real-time speeds of 264 FPS on a single 4090 GPU.

Existing methods lack transparency regarding their underlying algorithms or training datasets, rely on large, high-quality PV training data, and struggle to generalize to new geographic regions or varied environmental conditions without extensive re-training. These limitations lead to inconsistent detection outcomes, hindering large-scale deployment and data-driven grid optimization. In this paper, we investigate how large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged to overcome these challenges. Despite their promise, LLMs face several challenges in solar panel detection, including difficulties with multi-step logical processes, inconsistent output formatting, frequent misclassification of visually similar objects (e.g., shadows, parking lots), and low accuracy in complex tasks such as spatial localization and quantification. To overcome these issues, we propose the PV Assessment with LLMs (PVAL) framework, which incorporates task decomposition for more efficient workflows, output standardization for consistent and scalable formatting, few-shot prompting to enhance classification accuracy, and fine-tuning using curated PV datasets with detailed annotations. PVAL ensures transparency, scalability, and adaptability across heterogeneous datasets while minimizing computational overhead. By combining open-source accessibility with robust methodologies, PVAL establishes an automated and reproducible pipeline for solar panel detection, paving the way for large-scale renewable energy integration and optimized grid management."

With a focus on gender and professional bias, this work examines in which manner LLMs shape responses to ungendered prompts, contributing to biased outputs. This analysis uses a structured experimental method, giving different prompts involving three different professional job combinations, which are also characterized by a hierarchical relationship. This study uses Italian, a language with extensive grammatical gender differences, to highlight potential limitations in current LLMs' ability to generate objective text in non-English languages. Two popular LLM-based chatbots are examined, namely OpenAI ChatGPT (gpt-4o-mini) and Google Gemini (gemini-1.5-flash). Through APIs, we collected a range of 3600 responses. The results highlight how content generated by LLMs can perpetuate stereotypes. For example, Gemini associated 100% (ChatGPT 97%) of 'she' pronouns to the 'assistant' rather than the 'manager'. The presence of bias in AI-generated text can have significant implications in many fields, such as in the workplaces or in job selections, raising ethical concerns about its use. Understanding these risks is pivotal to developing mitigation strategies and assuring that AI-based systems do not increase social inequalities, but rather contribute to more equitable outcomes. Future research directions include expanding the study to additional chatbots or languages, refining prompt engineering methods or further exploiting a larger experimental base."

While these parameters are crucial, they only cover a small subset of malfunctioning mechanisms and usually can be monitored only if the CB is disconnected from the grid. To facilitate online condition monitoring while CBs remain connected, non-intrusive measurement techniques such as vibration or acoustic signals are necessary. Currently, CB condition monitoring studies using these signals typically utilize supervised methods for fault diagnostics, where ground-truth fault types are known due to artificially introduced faults in laboratory settings. This supervised approach is however not feasible in real-world applications, where fault labels are unavailable. In this work, we propose a novel unsupervised fault detection and segmentation framework for CBs based on vibration and acoustic signals. This framework can detect deviations from the healthy state. The explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) approach is applied to the detected faults for fault diagnostics. The specific contributions are: (1) we propose an integrated unsupervised fault detection and segmentation framework that is capable of detecting faults and clustering different faults with only healthy data required during training (2) we provide an unsupervised explainability-guided fault diagnostics approach using XAI to offer domain experts potential indications of the aged or faulty components, achieving fault diagnostics without the prerequisite of ground-truth fault labels. These contributions are validated using an experimental dataset from a high-voltage CB under healthy and artificially introduced fault conditions, contributing to more reliable CB system operation."

In this study, we explore the use of automatic cough analysis as a pre-screening tool for distinguishing between NSCLC patients and healthy controls. Cough audio recordings were prospectively acquired from a total of 227 subjects, divided into NSCLC patients and healthy controls. The recordings were analyzed using machine learning techniques, such as support vector machine (SVM) and XGBoost, as well as deep learning approaches, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNN) and transfer learning with VGG16. To enhance the interpretability of the machine learning model, we utilized Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP). The fairness of the models across demographic groups was assessed by comparing the performance of the best model across different age groups (less than or equal to 58y and higher than 58y) and gender using the equalized odds difference on the test set. The results demonstrate that CNN achieves the best performance, with an accuracy of 0.83 on the test set. Nevertheless, SVM achieves slightly lower performances (accuracy of 0.76 in validation and 0.78 in the test set), making it suitable in contexts with low computational power. The use of SHAP for SVM interpretation further enhances model transparency, making it more trustworthy for clinical applications. Fairness analysis shows slightly higher disparity across age (0.15) than gender (0.09) on the test set. Therefore, to strengthen our findings' reliability, a larger, more diverse, and unbiased dataset is needed -- particularly including individuals at risk of NSCLC and those in early disease stages."

However, it is known to incur a quadratic computational complexity with respect to the number of patches. One promising approach to address this issue is patch pruning, which improves computational efficiency by identifying and removing redundant patches. In this work, we propose a patch pruning strategy that evaluates the importance of each patch based on the variance of attention weights across multiple attention heads. This approach is inspired by the design of multi-head self-attention, which aims to capture diverse attention patterns across different subspaces of feature representations. The proposed method can be easily applied during both training and inference, and achieves improved throughput while maintaining classification accuracy in scenarios such as fine-tuning with pre-trained models. In addition, we also found that using robust statistical measures, such as the median absolute deviation in place of variance, to assess patch importance can similarly lead to strong performance. Furthermore, by introducing overlapping patch embeddings, our method achieves better performance with comparable throughput to conventional approaches that utilize all patches."

However, for applications such as autonomous driving, a unified model is necessary to perform restoration of corrupted images due to different weather conditions. We propose a continual learning approach to propose a unified framework for image restoration. The proposed framework integrates three key innovations: (1) Selective Kernel Fusion layers that dynamically combine global and local features for robust adaptive feature selection; (2) Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) to enable continual learning and mitigate catastrophic forgetting across multiple restoration tasks; and (3) a novel Cycle-Contrastive Loss that enhances feature discrimination while preserving semantic consistency during domain translation. Further, we propose an unpaired image restoration approach to reduce the dependance of the proposed approach on the training data. Extensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets for dehazing, desnowing and deraining tasks demonstrate significant improvements in PSNR, SSIM, and perceptual quality over the state-of-the-art."

Despite shared architecture and learning frameworks, they prioritize different goals: generation seeks high perceptual quality and diversity, while reconstruction focuses on data fidelity and faithfulness. In this work, we introduce a \"generative model zoo\" and systematically analyze how modern latent diffusion models and autoregressive models navigate the reconstruction-generation spectrum. We benchmark a suite of generative models across representative cardiac medical imaging tasks, focusing on image inpainting with varying masking ratios and sampling strategies, as well as unconditional image generation. Our findings show that diffusion models offer superior perceptual quality for unconditional generation but tend to hallucinate as masking ratios increase, whereas autoregressive models maintain stable perceptual performance across masking levels, albeit with generally lower fidelity."

Using both small- and medium-scale LLaMA models, we show that even minimal exposure to poisoned data significantly increases toxicity for AAVE inputs, while it remains comparatively unaffected for SAE. Larger models exhibit a more significant amplification effect which suggests heightened susceptibility with scale. To further assess these disparities, we employed GPT-4o as a fairness auditor, which identified harmful stereotypical patterns disproportionately tied to AAVE inputs, including portrayals of aggression, criminality, and intellectual inferiority.

Prior learning-based methods treat all input layers (e.g., metal, via, and current maps) equally, ignoring their varying importance to prediction accuracy. To tackle this, we propose a novel Weakness-Aware Channel Attention (WACA) mechanism, which recursively enhances weak feature channels while suppressing over-dominant ones through a two-stage gating strategy.

However, the development of accurate and robust methods is often limited by insufficient data availability and a lack of diversity in lesion characteristics. While generative models offer a promising solution for data synthesis, current approaches often fail to adequately emphasize lesion-specific features and their relationships with surrounding tissues. In this paper, we propose Gated Conditional Diffusion Model (GCDM), a novel framework designed to jointly synthesize holistic mammogram images and localized lesions. GCDM is built upon a latent denoising diffusion framework, where the noised latent image is concatenated with a soft mask embedding that represents breast, lesion, and their transitional regions, ensuring anatomical coherence between them during the denoising process. To further emphasize lesion-specific features, GCDM incorporates a gated conditioning branch that guides the denoising process by dynamically selecting and fusing the most relevant radiomic and geometric properties of lesions, effectively capturing their interplay. Experimental results demonstrate that GCDM achieves precise control over small lesion areas while enhancing the realism and diversity of synthesized mammograms. These advancements position GCDM as a promising tool for clinical applications in mammogram synthesis. Our code is available at https://github.com/lixinHUST/Gated-Conditional-Diffusion-Model/"

Effectively querying this data is essential to enable targeted analytics. In this work, we formalize point cloud querying by defining three core query types: RETRIEVAL, COUNT, and AGGREGATION, each aligned with distinct analytical scenarios. All these queries rely heavily on accurate object counts to produce meaningful results, making precise object counting a critical component of query execution. Prior work has focused on indexing techniques for 2D video data, assuming detection models provide accurate counting information. However, when applied to 3D point cloud data, state-of-the-art detection models often fail to generate reliable object counts, leading to substantial errors in query results. To address this limitation, we propose CounterNet, a heatmap-based network designed for accurate object counting in large-scale point cloud data. Rather than focusing on accurate object localization, CounterNet detects object presence by finding object centers to improve counting accuracy. We further enhance its performance with a feature map partitioning strategy using overlapping regions, enabling better handling of both small and large objects in complex traffic scenes. To adapt to varying frame characteristics, we introduce a per-frame dynamic model selection strategy that selects the most effective configuration for each input. Evaluations on three real-world autonomous vehicle datasets show that CounterNet improves counting accuracy by 5% to 20% across object categories, resulting in more reliable query outcomes across all supported query types."

In particular, functional dependencies (FDs) and logical dependencies (LDs), which capture deterministic and rule-based associations between features, are rarely or often poorly retained in synthetic datasets. To address this research gap, we propose the Hierarchical Feature Generation Framework (HFGF) for synthetic tabular data generation. We created benchmark datasets with known dependencies to evaluate our proposed HFGF. The framework first generates independent features using any standard generative model, and then reconstructs dependent features based on predefined FD and LD rules. Our experiments on four benchmark datasets with varying sizes, feature imbalance, and dependency complexity demonstrate that HFGF improves the preservation of FDs and LDs across six generative models, including CTGAN, TVAE, and GReaT. Our findings demonstrate that HFGF can significantly enhance the structural fidelity and downstream utility of synthetic tabular data."

Conventional saliency prediction models, typically employing segmentation approaches, rely on low-resolution imagery to generate saliency heatmaps, subsequently upscaled to native resolutions, which limiting their capacity to capture personalized attention patterns. Furthermore, MLLMs are constrained by factors such as hallucinations, making it very costly to strictly adhere to the expected format in tasks involving multiple point predictions, and achieving precise point positioning is challenging. To address these limitations, we present Subjective Personalized Attention for Advertisement Videos, namely SPA-ADV, a large-scale multimodal dataset capturing gaze behaviors from over 4,500 participants varying in age and gender with 486 videos. Furthermore, we propose PRE-MAP, a novel eye-tracking saliency model that characterizes Personalized visual disparities through Reinforcement learning-optimized Eye-tracking, built upon MLLMs and guided by Multi-Attribute user profiles to predict Points. To ensure MLLMs produce prediction points that are both format-correct and spatially accurate, we introduce Consistency Group Relative Policy Optimization (C-GRPO), inspired by the variability in eye movement points and Multi-Attribute profiles.

Existing benchmarks attempt to address these issues by keeping test cases permanently secret, mitigating contamination through human evaluation, or repeatedly collecting and constructing new samples. However, these approaches fail to ensure reproducibility, transparency, and high efficiency simultaneously. Moreover, the extent of overestimation in current LLMs remains unquantified.

While universal lesion segmentation models have advanced, they are typically designed for single time points. This paper investigates the performance of the ULS23 segmentation model in a longitudinal context. Using a public clinical dataset of baseline and follow-up CT scans, we evaluated the model's ability to segment and track lesions over time. We identified two critical, interconnected failure modes: a sharp degradation in segmentation quality in follow-up cases due to inter-scan registration errors, and a subsequent breakdown of the lesion correspondence process. To systematically probe this vulnerability, we conducted a controlled experiment where we artificially displaced the input volume relative to the true lesion center. Our results demonstrate that the model's performance is highly dependent on its assumption of a centered lesion; segmentation accuracy collapses when the lesion is sufficiently displaced. These findings reveal a fundamental limitation of applying single-timepoint models to longitudinal data. We conclude that robust oncological tracking requires a paradigm shift away from cascading single-purpose tools towards integrated, end-to-end models inherently designed for temporal analysis."

We adapt the power of a large language model (LLM) to digest the contextual complexity within textual input and convert the task into tangible subproblems such that we can generate multi-agent behavior beyond the scale that was not considered before. Specifically, our event generator formulates the temporal progression of a dynamic scene into a sequence of small events.

We employ a high-level module to deliver scalable yet comprehensive context, translating events into relative descriptions that enable the retrieval of precise coordinates.

While empirically powerful, a deep theoretical understanding of why this simple objective yields such versatile representations remains elusive. This work introduces a unifying analytical framework using Markov Categories (MCs) to deconstruct the AR generation process and the NLL objective. We model the single-step generation map as a composition of Markov kernels in the category Stoch. This compositional view, when enriched with statistical divergences, allows us to dissect information flow and learned geometry. Our framework makes three main contributions. First, we provide a formal, information-theoretic rationale for the success of modern speculative decoding methods like EAGLE, quantifying the information surplus in hidden states that these methods exploit. Second, we formalize how NLL minimization forces the model to learn not just the next token, but the data's intrinsic conditional stochasticity, a process we analyze using categorical entropy. Third, and most centrally, we prove that NLL training acts as an implicit form of spectral contrastive learning. By analyzing the information geometry of the model's prediction head, we show that NLL implicitly forces the learned representation space to align with the eigenspectrum of a predictive similarity operator, thereby learning a geometrically structured space without explicit contrastive pairs. This compositional and information-geometric perspective reveals the deep structural principles underlying the effectiveness of modern LMs. Project Page: https://github.com/asiresearch/lm-theory"

However, identifying 3D depth anomalies using only 2D information is insufficient. Despite explicitly fusing depth information into RGB images or using point cloud backbone networks to extract depth features, both approaches struggle to adequately represent 3D information in multimodal scenarios due to the disparities among different modal information. Additionally, due to the scarcity of abnormal samples in industrial data, especially in multimodal scenarios, it is necessary to perform anomaly generation to simulate real-world abnormal samples. Therefore, we propose a novel unified multimodal anomaly detection framework to address these issues. Our contributions consist of 3 key aspects. (1) We extract visible depth information from 3D point cloud data simply and use 2D RGB images to represent appearance, which disentangles depth and appearance to support unified anomaly generation. (2) Benefiting from the flexible input representation, the proposed Multi-Scale Gaussian Anomaly Generator and Unified Texture Anomaly Generator can generate richer anomalies in RGB and depth. (3) All modules share parameters for both RGB and depth data, effectively bridging 2D and 3D anomaly detection. Subsequent modules can directly leverage features from both modalities without complex fusion. Experiments show our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) on MVTec-3D AD and Eyecandies datasets.

In this paper, we introduce Person-Interaction Noise Optimization (PINO), a novel, training-free framework designed for generating realistic and customizable interactions among groups of arbitrary size. PINO decomposes complex group interactions into semantically relevant pairwise interactions, and leverages pretrained two-person interaction diffusion models to incrementally compose group interactions. To ensure physical plausibility and avoid common artifacts such as overlapping or penetration between characters, PINO employs physics-based penalties during noise optimization.

To address these limitations, analyzing blood cells using deep learning-based object detectors can be regarded as a feasible solution. In this study, we propose automatic blood cell detection method (ABCD) based on an improved version of YOLOX, an object detector, for detecting various types of blood cells, including white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets.

We show that: (1) negative news posts constitute a relatively small fraction (12.6%); (2) political news posts are neither more nor less negative than non-political news posts; (3) U.S. political news posts are less negative relative to the other countries on average (40% lower odds); (4) Negative news posts get 15% fewer likes and 13% fewer comments than non-negative news posts. Lastly, (5) we provide estimates of the proportion of the total volume of user engagement with negative news posts and show that only between 10.2% to 13.1% of engagement is linked to negative posts by the analyzed news organizations."

This paper examines whether LLMs can identify and classify fine-grained forms of populism, a complex and contested concept in both academic and media debates. To this end, we curate and release novel datasets specifically designed to capture populist discourse. We evaluate a range of pre-trained (large) language models, both open-weight and proprietary, across multiple prompting paradigms. Our analysis reveals notable variation in performance, highlighting the limitations of LLMs in detecting populist discourse. We find that a fine-tuned RoBERTa classifier vastly outperforms all new-era instruction-tuned LLMs, unless fine-tuned. Additionally, we apply our best-performing model to analyze campaign speeches by Donald Trump, extracting valuable insights into his strategic use of populist rhetoric. Finally, we assess the generalizability of these models by benchmarking them on campaign speeches by European politicians, offering a lens into cross-context transferability in political discourse analysis. In this setting, we find that instruction-tuned LLMs exhibit greater robustness on out-of-domain data."

To address real-world challenges in outdoor 3D object detection, fusion of LiDAR and RGB input has started gaining traction. However, effective integration of these modalities for precise object detection task still remains a largely open problem. To address that, we propose a MultiStream Detection (MuStD) network, that meticulously extracts task-relevant information from both data modalities. The network follows a three-stream structure. Its LiDAR-PillarNet stream extracts sparse 2D pillar features from the LiDAR input while the LiDAR-Height Compression stream computes Bird's-Eye View features. An additional 3D Multimodal stream combines RGB and LiDAR features using UV mapping and polar coordinate indexing. Eventually, the features containing comprehensive spatial, textural and geometric information are carefully fused and fed to a detection head for 3D object detection.

However, there are multiple challenges to be addressed, most notably, blood-vessel structure sparsity, poor background and blood vessel distinction, sparse-views, and intra-scan motion. State-of-the-art reconstruction approaches rely on time-consuming manual or error-prone automatic segmentations, limiting clinical usability. Recently, approaches based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown promise for automatic reconstructions in the sparse-view setting. However, they suffer from long training times due to their dependence on MLP-based representations. We propose NerT-CA, a hybrid approach of Neural and Tensorial representations for accelerated 4D reconstructions with sparse-view CA. Building on top of the previous NeRF-based work, we model the CA scene as a decomposition of low-rank and sparse components, utilizing fast tensorial fields for low-rank static reconstruction and neural fields for dynamic sparse reconstruction. Our approach outperforms previous works in both training time and reconstruction accuracy, yielding reasonable reconstructions from as few as three angiogram views. We validate our approach quantitatively and qualitatively on representative 4D phantom datasets."

To address these issues, we propose SPADA for SPArse Dependency-driven Augmentation, a lightweight generative framework that explicitly captures sparse dependencies via an LLM-induced graph. We treat each feature as a node and synthesize values by traversing the graph, conditioning each feature solely on its parent nodes. We explore two synthesis strategies: a non-parametric method using Gaussian kernel density estimation, and a conditional normalizing flow model that learns invertible mappings for conditional density estimation. Experiments on four datasets show that SPADA reduces constraint violations by 4% compared to diffusion-based methods and accelerates generation by nearly 9,500 times over LLM-based baselines."

As a result, established platforms in other domains, such as e-commerce, have begun introducing short-form video content to engage users and increase their time spent on the platform. The success of these experiences is due not only to the content itself but also to a unique UI innovation: instead of offering users a list of choices to click, platforms actively recommend content for users to watch one at a time. This creates new challenges for recommender systems, especially when launching a new video experience. Beyond the limited interaction data, immersive feed experiences introduce stronger position bias due to the UI and duration bias when optimizing for watch-time, as models tend to favor shorter videos. These issues, together with the feedback loop inherent in recommender systems, make it difficult to build effective solutions. In this paper, we highlight the challenges faced when introducing a new short-form video experience and present our experience showing that, even with sufficient video interaction data, it can be more beneficial to leverage a video retrieval system using a fine-tuned multimodal vision-language model to overcome these challenges. This approach demonstrated greater effectiveness compared to conventional supervised learning methods in online experiments conducted on our e-commerce platform."

This work explores the reconstruction of such spatial signals from sparse measurements using Group Equivariant Non-Expansive Operators (GENEOs), offering a low-complexity alternative to traditional neural networks. The concept of GENEO, which originated in topological data analysis (TDA), is a mathematical tool used in machine learning to represent agents modelled as functional operators acting on data while incorporating application-specific invariances. Leveraging these invariances reduces the number of parameters with respect to traditional neural networks and mitigates data scarcity by enforcing known algebraic and geometric constraints that reflect symmetries in the agents' actions. In this paper, we introduce a novel GENEO-based approach for SINR map reconstruction in urban wireless communication networks using extremely sparse sampling. We demonstrate that this mathematical framework achieves competitive performance compared to established methods. Our evaluation, conducted using both statistical and TDA metrics, highlights the advantages of our approach in accurately reconstructing spatial signals under severe data limitations on the number of samples."

However, Recurrent LLMs often underperform on long-context tasks due to their limited fixed-size memory. Previous research has primarily focused on enhancing the memory capacity of Recurrent LLMs through architectural innovations, but these approaches have not yet enabled Recurrent LLMs to match the performance of Self-Attention LLMs on long-context tasks. We argue that this limitation arises because processing the entire context at once is not well-suited for Recurrent LLMs. In this paper, we propose Smooth Reading, a chunk-wise inference method inspired by human reading strategies. Smooth Reading processes context in chunks and iteratively summarizes the contextual information, thereby reducing memory demands and making the approach more compatible with Recurrent LLMs. Our experimental results show that this method substantially narrows the performance gap between Recurrent and Self-Attention LLMs on long-context tasks, while preserving the efficiency advantages of Recurrent LLMs. Our Smooth Reading boosts SWA-3B-4k (a Recurrent LLM) from 5.68% lower to 3.61% higher performance than Self-Attention LLMs on LongBench. Besides, our method maintains the high efficiency, training 3x faster and inferring 2x faster at 64k context compared to Self-Attention LLMs. To our knowledge, this is the first work to achieve comparable performance using Recurrent LLMs compared with Self-Attention LLMs on long-context tasks. We hope our method will inspire future research in this area. To facilitate further progress, we will release code and dataset."

EffiComm operates on Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) feature maps from any modality and applies a two-stage reduction pipeline: (1) Selective Transmission (ST) prunes low-utility regions with a confidence mask; (2) Adaptive Grid Reduction (AGR) uses a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to assign vehicle-specific keep ratios according to role and network load.

To address this issue, we propose an efficient ViT adaptation framework that enables a single adaptation process to generate multiple models of varying sizes for deployment on platforms with various resource constraints. Our approach comprises two stages. In the first stage, we enhance a pre-trained ViT with a nested elastic architecture that enables structural flexibility across MLP expansion ratio, number of attention heads, embedding dimension, and network depth. To preserve pre-trained knowledge and ensure stable adaptation, we adopt a curriculum-based training strategy that progressively increases elasticity. In the second stage, we design a lightweight router to select submodels according to computational budgets and downstream task demands. Initialized with Pareto-optimal configurations derived via a customized NSGA-II algorithm, the router is then jointly optimized with the backbone.

Counterfactual explanations provide comprehensible insights into decision processes by presenting hypothetical \"what-if\" scenarios that alter model classifications. By examining input alterations, counterfactual explanations provide patterns that influence the decision-making process. Despite their potential, generating plausible counterfactuals that adhere to similarity constraints providing human-interpretable explanations remains a challenge. In this paper, we investigate this challenge by a model-specific optimization approach. While deep generative models such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) exhibit significant generative power, probabilistic models like sum-product networks (SPNs) efficiently represent complex joint probability distributions. By modeling the likelihood of a semi-supervised VAE's latent space with an SPN, we leverage its dual role as both a latent space descriptor and a classifier for a given discrimination task. This formulation enables the optimization of latent space counterfactuals that are both close to the original data distribution and aligned with the target class distribution. We conduct experimental evaluation on the cheXpert dataset. To evaluate the effectiveness of the integration of SPNs, our SPN-guided latent space manipulation is compared against a neural network baseline. Additionally, the trade-off between latent variable regularization and counterfactual quality is analyzed."

Scene captioning, which generates natural language descriptions of the driving environment, plays a crucial role in enhancing transparency, safety, and human-AI interaction. We introduce BEV-LLM, a lightweight model for 3D captioning of autonomous driving scenes. BEV-LLM leverages BEVFusion to combine 3D LiDAR point clouds and multi-view images, incorporating a novel absolute positional encoding for view-specific scene descriptions. Despite using a small 1B parameter base model, BEV-LLM achieves competitive performance on the nuCaption dataset, surpassing state-of-the-art by up to 5\\% in BLEU scores. Additionally, we release two new datasets - nuView (focused on environmental conditions and viewpoints) and GroundView (focused on object grounding) - to better assess scene captioning across diverse driving scenarios and address gaps in current benchmarks, along with initial benchmarking results demonstrating their effectiveness."

Anonymized free text clinical progress notes of patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) of one academic hospital and discharge letters of patients admitted to Internal Medicine wards of two non-academic hospitals were reused. We evaluated our ADE RC models internally using gold standard (two-step task) and predicted entities (end-to-end task). In addition, all models were externally validated on detecting ADEs at the document level. We report both micro- and macro-averaged F1 scores, given the imbalance of ADEs in the datasets. Although differences for the ADE RC task between the models were small, MedRoBERTa.nl was the best performing model with macro-averaged F1 score of 0.63 using gold standard and 0.62 using predicted entities. The MedRoBERTa.nl models also performed the best in our external validation and achieved recall of between 0.67 to 0.74 using predicted entities, meaning between 67 to 74% of discharge letters with ADEs were detected. Our benchmark study presents a robust and clinically meaningful approach for evaluating language models for ADE detection in clinical free text documents.

However, the inherent class imbalance in the distribution of clinical findings presents a significant challenge for current self-supervised deep learning models. These models often fail to accurately classify long-tailed classes. Current Vision-Language models such as Contrastive Language Image Pre-training (CLIP) models effectively model the manifold distribution of the latent space, enabling high zero-shot classification accuracies. Although CLIP performs well on most of the primary classes in the dataset, our work reveals that its effectiveness decreases significantly for classes with a long-tailed distribution. Our approach employs a class-weighting mechanism that directly aligns with the distribution of classes within the latent space. This method ensures a substantial improvement in overall classification performance, with particular emphasis on enhancing the recognition and accuracy of rarely observed classes. We accomplish this by applying Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) clustering to the latent space. The subsequent clusters are further refined by Student t-distribution, followed by a metric loss that utilizes the altered embeddings. Our approach facilitates stable and adaptive clustering of the features. This results in a notable average improvement of 7\\% points in zero-shot AUC scores across 40 classes in the MIMIC-CXR-JPG dataset from previous SOTA models."

Second, existing evaluations are often inadequate: even widely used benchmarks fail to generalize across the full spectrum of real world medical tasks.\n  To address these gaps, we leverage MEDTE, a GTE model extensively fine-tuned on diverse medical corpora through self-supervised contrastive learning across multiple data sources, to deliver robust medical text embeddings.\n  Alongside this model, we propose a comprehensive benchmark suite of 51 tasks spanning classification, clustering, pair classification, and retrieval modeled on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) but tailored to the nuances of medical text.

In medicine, these models can admit conflicting predictions for the same patient -- a risk that is poorly understood and insufficiently addressed.\n  In this study, we empirically analyze the extent, drivers, and ramifications of predictive multiplicity across diverse medical tasks and model architectures, and show that even small ensembles can mitigate/eliminate predictive multiplicity in practice. Our analysis reveals that (1) standard validation metrics fail to identify a uniquely optimal model and (2) a substantial amount of predictions hinges on arbitrary choices made during model development. Using multiple models instead of a single model reveals instances where predictions differ across equally plausible models -- highlighting patients that would receive arbitrary diagnoses if any single model were used. In contrast, (3) a small ensemble paired with an abstention strategy can effectively mitigate measurable predictive multiplicity in practice; predictions with high inter-model consensus may thus be amenable to automated classification. While accuracy is not a principled antidote to predictive multiplicity, we find that (4) higher accuracy achieved through increased model capacity reduces predictive multiplicity.\n  Our findings underscore the clinical importance of accounting for model multiplicity and advocate for ensemble-based strategies to improve diagnostic reliability. In cases where models fail to reach sufficient consensus, we recommend deferring decisions to expert review."

While these strategies allow input lengths to scale to millions of tokens, they do not fundamentally mitigate the quadratic computational and memory complexity of the core attention mechanism. In this paper, we address the challenge of long-context processing on a single device using generic implementations by reducing the quadratic memory footprint and inference cost. Existing approaches to extend the context length for generic single device implementations -- such as token merging and modified attentions -- are often modality specific and attain a suboptimal tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose MAELRE (Modality Agnostic Efficient Long Range Encoder), a unified and efficient transformer architecture designed for long-range encoding across diverse modalities. MAELRE integrates token merging with attention approximation, progressively merging tokens at different stages of internal computational blocks. It employs a lightweight attention approximation when the number of tokens is large, and switches to standard dot-product attention as the sequence becomes shorter through successive aggregation. We demonstrate that MAELRE achieves superior accuracy while reducing computational cost compared to existing long-context models on classification tasks spanning multiple modalities, including text, time series, audio, and vision."

The SILS framework offers a significantly more detailed approach, characterizing LPs not just as capital holders but as dynamic systemic agents whose actions directly impact market stability. This represents a fundamental paradigm shift from the static, volume-based analysis to a dynamic, impact-focused understanding. This advanced approach uses on-chain event logs and smart contract execution traces to compute Exponential Time-Weighted Liquidity (ETWL) profiles and apply unsupervised anomaly detection. Most importantly, it defines an LP's functional importance through the Liquidity Stability Impact Score (LSIS), a counterfactual metric that measures the potential degradation of the market if the LP withdraws. This combined approach provides a more detailed and realistic characterization of an LP's impact, moving beyond the binary and often misleading classifications used by existing methods. This impact-focused and comprehensive approach enables SILS to accurately identify high-impact LPs-including those missed by traditional methods and supports essential applications like a protective oracle layer and actionable trader signals, thereby significantly enhancing DeFi ecosystem. The framework provides unprecedented transparency into the underlying liquidity structure and associated risks, effectively reducing the common false positives and uncovering critical false negatives found in traditional models. Therefore, SILS provides an effective mechanism for proactive risk management, transforming how DeFi protocols safeguard their ecosystems against asymmetric liquidity behavior."

To achieve a more robust and reliable representation, we design a novel trustworthy information fusion strategy.

Moreover, DEFNet exploits advanced uncertainty estimation technique inspired by evidential learning with the help of normal-inverse gamma distribution mixture. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and authentic distortion datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework. Additional evaluation and analysis are carried out to highlight its strong generalization capability and adaptability to previously unseen scenarios."

In this work, we introduce a systematic, circuit-based framework designed to investigate how spatiotemporal visual semantics are represented and processed within these LVLMs. Specifically, our framework comprises three circuits: visual auditing circuit, semantic tracing circuit, and attention flow circuit. Through the lens of these circuits, we discover that visual semantics are highly localized to specific object tokens--removing these tokens can degrade model performance by up to 92.6%. Furthermore, we identify that interpretable concepts of objects and actions emerge and become progressively refined in the middle-to-late layers of LVLMs. In contrary to the current works that solely focus on objects in one image, we reveal that the middle-to-late layers of LVLMs exhibit specialized functional localization for spatiotemporal semantics. Our findings offer significant mechanistic insights into spatiotemporal semantics analysis of LVLMs, laying a foundation for designing more robust and interpretable models."

This paper introduces Step-3, a 321B-parameter VLM with hardware-aware model-system co-design optimized for minimizing decoding costs. Step-3 innovates in two key dimensions: (1) A novel Multi-Matrix Factorization Attention (MFA) mechanism that significantly reduces both KV cache size and computation while maintaining high attention expressiveness, and (2) Attention-FFN Disaggregation (AFD), a distributed inference system that decouples attention and Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layers into specialized subsystems. This co-design achieves unprecedented cost efficiency: Step-3 significantly reduces theoretical decoding costs compared with models like DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3 MoE 235B, with the gains widening at longer context. Step-3 achieves low cost while activating 38B parameters per token (more than DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3 MoE 235B), demonstrating that hardware-aligned attention arithmetic intensity, MoE sparsity, and AFD are critical to cost-effectiveness. We perform a head-to-head comparison with DeepSeek-V3 in its favorable scenarios.

We recast context-based RL as a dual inference-control problem and formally characterize two properties and their hierarchy: observation sufficiency (preserving all predictive information) and control sufficiency (retaining decision-making relevant information). Exploiting this dichotomy, we derive a contextual evidence lower bound(ELBO)-style objective that cleanly separates representation learning from policy learning and optimizes it with Bottlenecked Contextual Policy Optimization (BCPO), an algorithm that places a variational information-bottleneck encoder in front of any off-policy policy learner. On standard continuous-control benchmarks with shifting physical parameters, BCPO matches or surpasses other baselines while using fewer samples and retaining performance far outside the training regime. The framework unifies theory, diagnostics, and practice for context-based RL."

However, existing methods predominantly rely on LiDAR-based occupancy annotations, which limits scalability and prevents leveraging vast amounts of potential crowdsourced data for auto-labeling. To address this, we propose GS-Occ3D, a scalable vision-only framework that directly reconstructs occupancy. Vision-only occupancy reconstruction poses significant challenges due to sparse viewpoints, dynamic scene elements, severe occlusions, and long-horizon motion. Existing vision-based methods primarily rely on mesh representation, which suffer from incomplete geometry and additional post-processing, limiting scalability. To overcome these issues, GS-Occ3D optimizes an explicit occupancy representation using an Octree-based Gaussian Surfel formulation, ensuring efficiency and scalability. Additionally, we decompose scenes into static background, ground, and dynamic objects, enabling tailored modeling strategies: (1) Ground is explicitly reconstructed as a dominant structural element, significantly improving large-area consistency; (2) Dynamic vehicles are separately modeled to better capture motion-related occupancy patterns. Extensive experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that GS-Occ3D achieves state-of-the-art geometry reconstruction results. By curating vision-only binary occupancy labels from diverse urban scenes, we show their effectiveness for downstream occupancy models on Occ3D-Waymo and superior zero-shot generalization on Occ3D-nuScenes. It highlights the potential of large-scale vision-based occupancy reconstruction as a new paradigm for autonomous driving perception. Project Page: https://gs-occ3d.github.io/"

We present Forest-Guided Clustering (FGC), a model-specific explainability method that reveals both local and global structure in RFs by grouping instances according to shared decision paths. FGC produces human-interpretable clusters aligned with the model's internal logic and computes cluster-specific and global feature importance scores to derive decision rules underlying RF predictions. FGC accurately recovered latent subclass structure on a benchmark dataset and outperformed classical clustering and post-hoc explanation methods. Applied to an AML transcriptomic dataset, FGC uncovered biologically coherent subpopulations, disentangled disease-relevant signals from confounders, and recovered known and novel gene expression patterns. FGC bridges the gap between performance and interpretability by providing structure-aware insights that go beyond feature-level attribution."

We argue that the interpretable nature of language can often provide a much richer learning medium for LLMs, compared with policy gradients derived from sparse, scalar rewards. To test this, we introduce GEPA (Genetic-Pareto), a prompt optimizer that thoroughly incorporates natural language reflection to learn high-level rules from trial and error. Given any AI system containing one or more LLM prompts, GEPA samples system-level trajectories (e.g., reasoning, tool calls, and tool outputs) and reflects on them in natural language to diagnose problems, propose and test prompt updates, and combine complementary lessons from the Pareto frontier of its own attempts. As a result of GEPA's design, it can often turn even just a few rollouts into a large quality gain. Across four tasks, GEPA outperforms GRPO by 10% on average and by up to 20%, while using up to 35x fewer rollouts. GEPA also outperforms the leading prompt optimizer, MIPROv2, by over 10% across two LLMs, and demonstrates promising results as an inference-time search strategy for code optimization."

Although these methods are attractive, they hold two major limitations that prevent their use in space applications: they require poses during training, and have high computational cost at training and inference. To address these limitations, this work contributes: (1) a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based primitive initializer for 3DGS using monocular images; (2) a pipeline capable of training with noisy or implicit pose estimates; and (3) and analysis of initialization variants that reduce the training cost of precise 3D models. A CNN takes a single image as input and outputs a coarse 3D model represented as an assembly of primitives, along with the target's pose relative to the camera. This assembly of primitives is then used to initialize 3DGS, significantly reducing the number of training iterations and input images needed -- by at least an order of magnitude. For additional flexibility, the CNN component has multiple variants with different pose estimation techniques. This work performs a comparison between these variants, evaluating their effectiveness for downstream 3DGS training under noisy or implicit pose estimates. The results demonstrate that even with imperfect pose supervision, the pipeline is able to learn high-fidelity 3D representations, opening the door for the use of novel view synthesis in space applications."

Additionally, the unprecedented success of recent reasoning models and Deep Research-style models suggests that technology capable of greatly improving forecasting performance has been developed. Therefore, based on these positive recent trends, we argue that the time is ripe for research on large-scale training of superforecaster-level event forecasting LLMs. We discuss two key research directions: training methods and data acquisition. For training, we first introduce three difficulties of LLM-based event forecasting training: noisiness-sparsity, knowledge cut-off, and simple reward structure problems. Then, we present related ideas to mitigate these problems: hypothetical event Bayesian networks, utilizing poorly-recalled and counterfactual events, and auxiliary reward signals. For data, we propose aggressive use of market, public, and crawling datasets to enable large-scale training and evaluation. Finally, we explain how these technical advances could enable AI to provide predictive intelligence to society in broader areas.

Existing approaches to build generalizable priors for 3D head avatars often adopt a holistic modeling approach, treating the face and hair as an inseparable entity. This overlooks the inherent compositionality of the human head, making it difficult for the model to naturally disentangle face and hair representations, especially when the dataset is limited. Furthermore, such holistic models struggle to support applications like 3D face and hairstyle swapping in a flexible and controllable manner. To address these challenges, we introduce a prior model that explicitly accounts for the compositionality of face and hair, learning their latent spaces separately. A key enabler of this approach is our synthetic hairless data creation pipeline, which removes hair from studio-captured datasets using estimated hairless geometry and texture derived from a diffusion prior. By leveraging a paired dataset of hair and hairless captures, we train disentangled prior models for face and hair, incorporating compositionality as an inductive bias to facilitate effective separation. Our model's inherent compositionality enables seamless transfer of face and hair components between avatars while preserving identity. Additionally, we demonstrate that our model can be fine-tuned in a few-shot manner using monocular captures to create high-fidelity, hair-compositional 3D head avatars for unseen subjects. These capabilities highlight the practical applicability of our approach in real-world scenarios, paving the way for flexible and expressive 3D avatar generation."

In particular, limited-area model (LAM) and stretched-grid model (SGM) approaches have emerged for generating high-resolution regional forecasts, based on initial conditions from a regional (re)analysis. While LAM uses lateral boundaries from an external global model, SGM incorporates a global domain at lower resolution. This study aims to understand how the differences in model design impact relative performance and potential applications. Specifically, the strengths and weaknesses of these two approaches are identified for generating deterministic regional forecasts over Europe. Using the Anemoi framework, models of both types are built by minimally adapting a shared architecture and trained using global and regional reanalyses in a near-identical setup. Several inference experiments have been conducted to explore their relative performance and highlight key differences. Results show that both LAM and SGM are competitive deterministic MLWP models with generally accurate and comparable forecasting performance over the regional domain. Various differences were identified in the performance of the models across applications. LAM is able to successfully exploit high-quality boundary forcings to make predictions within the regional domain and is suitable in contexts where global data is difficult to acquire. SGM is fully self-contained for easier operationalisation, can take advantage of more training data and significantly surpasses LAM in terms of (temporal) generalisability. Our paper can serve as a starting point for meteorological institutes to guide their choice between LAM and SGM in developing an operational data-driven forecasting system."

To explore how interacting with an LLM instead of a human might shift cooperative behavior in such settings, we used the Prisoner's Dilemma game -- a surrogate of several real-world managerial and economic scenarios. In Experiment 1 (N=100), participants engaged in a thirty-round repeated game against a human, a classic bot, and an LLM (GPT, in real-time). In Experiment 2 (N=192), participants played a one-shot game against a human or an LLM, with half of them allowed to communicate with their opponent, enabling LLMs to leverage a key advantage over older-generation machines. Cooperation rates with LLMs -- while lower by approximately 10-15 percentage points compared to interactions with human opponents -- were nonetheless high. This finding was particularly notable in Experiment 2, where the psychological cost of selfish behavior was reduced. Although allowing communication about cooperation did not close the human-machine behavioral gap, it increased the likelihood of cooperation with both humans and LLMs equally (by 88%), which is particularly surprising for LLMs given their non-human nature and the assumption that people might be less receptive to cooperating with machines compared to human counterparts. Additionally, cooperation with LLMs was higher following prior interaction with humans, suggesting a spillover effect in cooperative behavior. Our findings validate the (careful) use of LLMs by businesses in settings that have a cooperative component."

To enhance the scalability of the existing neural adjoint method, we present a novel forward neural network architecture for OMTs and introduce a material loss function into the existing neural adjoint loss function, facilitating the exploration of material configurations of OMTs. Furthermore, we present the detailed formulation of the regression activation mapping for the presented forward neural network architecture (F-RAM), a feature visualization method aimed at improving interpretability. We validated the efficacy of the material loss by conducting an ablation study, where each component of the loss function is systematically removed and evaluated. The results indicated that the inclusion of the material loss significantly improves accuracy and diversity. To substantiate the performance of the ENA-based inverse design, we compared it against the residual network-based global optimization network (Res-GLOnet). The ENA yielded the OMT solutions of an inverse design with higher accuracy and better diversity compared to the Res-GLOnet. To demonstrate the interpretability, we applied F-RAM to diverse OMT structures with similar optical properties, obtained by the proposed ENA method. We showed that distributions of feature importance for various OMT structures exhibiting analogous optical properties are consistent, despite variations in material configurations, layer number, and thicknesses. Furthermore, we demonstrate the flexibility of the ENA method by restricting the initial layer of OMTs to SiO2 and 100 nm."

Traditional maintenance and rehabilitation planning methods often face scalability and computational challenges, particularly for large-scale networks with thousands of assets under budget constraints. This paper presents a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that optimizes asset management strategies for large infrastructure networks. By decomposing the network-level Markov Decision Process (MDP) into individual asset-level MDPs while using a unified neural network architecture, the proposed framework reduces computational complexity, improves learning efficiency, and enhances scalability. The framework directly incorporates annual budget constraints through a budget allocation mechanism, ensuring maintenance plans are both optimal and cost-effective. Through a case study on a large-scale pavement network of 68,800 segments, the proposed DRL framework demonstrates significant improvements over traditional methods like Progressive Linear Programming and genetic algorithms, both in efficiency and network performance. This advancement contributes to infrastructure asset management and the broader application of reinforcement learning in complex, large-scale environments."

Static optimization and cost-sharing methods often fail to adapt to evolving inequities, leading to participant dissatisfaction and unsustainable cooperation. This paper proposes a novel framework that integrates multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming (MILP), cooperative game theory, and a dynamic equity-adjustment mechanism driven by reinforcement learning (RL). At its core, the framework utilizes a bi-level optimization model grounded in Equity-regarding Welfare Maximization (EqWM) principles, which incorporate Rawlsian fairness to prioritize the welfare of the least advantaged participants. We introduce a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent that dynamically adjusts socio-economic weights in the optimization objective based on observed inequities in cost and renewable energy access. This RL-powered feedback loop enables the system to learn and adapt, continuously striving for a more equitable state. To ensure transparency, Explainable AI (XAI) is used to interpret the benefit allocations derived from a weighted Shapley value. Validated across six realistic scenarios, the framework demonstrates peak demand reductions of up to 72.6%, and significant cooperative gains. The adaptive RL mechanism further reduces the Gini coefficient over time, showcasing a pathway to truly sustainable and fair energy communities."

The motion of the rafts is represented by a high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical system. Referred to as the eBOMB model, this builds on the Maxey--Riley equation by incorporating interactions between clumps of \\emph{Sargassum} forming a raft and the effects of Earth's rotation. The absence of a predictive law for the rafts' centers of mass suggests a need for machine learning. In this paper, we evaluate and contrast Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy). In both cases, a physics-inspired closure modeling approach is taken rooted in eBOMB. Specifically, the LSTM model learns a mapping from a collection of eBOMB variables to the difference between raft center-of-mass and ocean velocities. The SINDy model's library of candidate functions is suggested by eBOMB variables and includes windowed velocity terms incorporating far-field effects of the carrying flow. Both LSTM and SINDy models perform most effectively in conditions with tightly bonded clumps, despite declining precision with rising complexity, such as with wind effects and when assessing loosely connected clumps. The LSTM model delivered the best results when designs were straightforward, with fewer neurons and hidden layers. While LSTM model serves as an opaque black-box model lacking interpretability, the SINDy model brings transparency by discerning explicit functional relationships through the function libraries. Integration of the windowed velocity terms enabled effective modeling of nonlocal interactions, particularly in datasets featuring sparsely connected rafts."

In particular, letting $\\hat{\\lambda}_l^\\varepsilon$ denote the $l$-th eigenvalue of $\\Delta_n$, and under suitable assumptions on the data generating model and on the rate of decay of $\\varepsilon$, we prove that $\\sqrt{n } (\\hat{\\lambda}_{l}^\\varepsilon - \\mathbb{E}[\\hat{\\lambda}_{l}^\\varepsilon] )$ is asymptotically Gaussian with a variance that we can explicitly characterize. A formal argument allows us to interpret this asymptotic variance as the dissipation of a gradient flow of a suitable energy with respect to the Fisher-Rao geometry. This geometric interpretation allows us to give, in turn, a statistical interpretation of the asymptotic variance in terms of a Cramer-Rao lower bound for the estimation of the eigenvalues of certain weighted Laplace-Beltrami operator. The latter interpretation suggests a form of asymptotic statistical efficiency for the eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian. We also present CLTs for multiple eigenvalues and through several numerical experiments explore the validity of our results when some of the assumptions that we make in our theoretical analysis are relaxed."

In such deployments, parts of the environment may change between subsequent robot observations. Most robotic mapping or environment modeling algorithms are incapable of representing dynamic features in a way that enables predicting their future state. Instead, they opt to filter certain state observations, either by removing them or some form of weighted averaging. This paper introduces Perpetua, a method for modeling the dynamics of semi-static features. Perpetua is able to: incorporate prior knowledge about the dynamics of the feature if it exists, track multiple hypotheses, and adapt over time to enable predicting of future feature states. Specifically, we chain together mixtures of \"persistence\" and \"emergence\" filters to model the probability that features will disappear or reappear in a formal Bayesian framework. The approach is an efficient, scalable, general, and robust method for estimating the states of features in an environment, both in the present as well as at arbitrary future times. Through experiments on simulated and real-world data, we find that Perpetua yields better accuracy than similar approaches while also being online adaptable and robust to missing observations."

This limb coordination strategy is utilized by swimmers across a wide range of Reynolds numbers, which suggests that this metachronal rhythm was selected for its optimality of swimming performance. In this study, we apply reinforcement learning to a swimmer at zero Reynolds number and investigate whether the learning algorithm selects this metachronal rhythm, or if other coordination patterns emerge. We design the swimmer agent with an elongated body and pairs of straight, inflexible paddles placed along the body for various fixed paddle spacings. Based on paddle spacing, the swimmer agent learns qualitatively different coordination patterns. At tight spacings, a back-to-front metachronal wave-like stroke emerges which resembles the commonly observed biological rhythm, but at wide spacings, different limb coordinations are selected. Across all resulting strokes, the fastest stroke is dependent on the number of paddles, however, the most efficient stroke is a back-to-front wave-like stroke regardless of the number of paddles."

Effective methods for inferring causal relationships from observational data must perform well under finite data and time constraints, where \"performing well\" implies achieving high, though not perfect accuracy. In his seminal paper A Theory of the Learnable, Valiant highlighted the importance of resource constraints in supervised machine learning, introducing the concept of Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning as an alternative to exact learning. Inspired by Valiant's work, we propose the Probably Approximately Correct Causal (PACC) Discovery framework, which extends PAC learning principles to the causal field. This framework emphasizes both computational and sample efficiency for established causal methods such as propensity score techniques and instrumental variable approaches. Furthermore, we show that it can also provide theoretical guarantees for other widely used methods, such as the Self-Controlled Case Series (SCCS) method, which had previously lacked such guarantees."

Owing to limited computational resources, operational medium-range temperature forecasts typically rely on low-resolution NWP models, which are prone to systematic and random errors. To resolve these limitations, the proposed method first reduces systematic errors through CNN-based post-processing (bias correction and spatial super-resolution) on each ensemble member, reconstructing high-resolution temperature fields from low-resolution model outputs. Second, it reduces random errors through ensemble averaging of the CNN-corrected members. This study also investigates whether the sequence of CNN correction and ensemble averaging affects the forecast accuracy. For comparison with the proposed method, we additionally conducted experiments with the CNN trained on ensemble-averaged forecasts. The first approach--CNN correction before ensemble averaging--consistently achieved higher accuracy than the reverse approach. Although based on low-resolution ensemble forecasts, the proposed method notably outperformed the high-resolution deterministic NWP models. These findings indicate that combining CNN-based correction with ensemble averaging effectively reduces both the systematic and random errors in NWP model outputs. The proposed approach is a practical and scalable solution for improving medium-range temperature forecasts, and is particularly valuable at operational centers with limited computational resources."

Time series capture the behavior of many large-scale real-world processes, from stock market trends to urban activities. Users often gain insights by visualizing them as line charts, juxtaposing or superposing multiple time series to compare them and identify trends and patterns. However, existing representations struggle with scalability: when covering long time spans, leading to visual clutter from too many small multiples or overlapping lines. We propose TiVy, a new algorithm that summarizes time series using sequential patterns. It transforms the series into a set of symbolic sequences based on subsequence visual similarity using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), then constructs a disjoint grouping of similar subsequences based on the frequent sequential patterns. The grouping result, a visual summary of time series, provides uncluttered superposition with fewer small multiples. Unlike common clustering techniques, TiVy extracts similar subsequences (of varying lengths) aligned in time. We also present an interactive time series visualization that renders large-scale time series in real-time. Our experimental evaluation shows that our algorithm (1) extracts clear and accurate patterns when visualizing time series data, (2) achieves a significant speed-up (1000X) compared to a straightforward DTW clustering. We also demonstrate the efficiency of our approach to explore hidden structures in massive time series data in two usage scenarios."

To stay competitive, enterprises strive to remain agile through the implementation of efficient and effective decision-making strategies in reaction to disruptions. A significant effort has been made to develop these agile disruption mitigation approaches, leveraging both centralized and distributed decision-making strategies. Though trade-offs of centralized and distributed approaches have been analyzed in existing studies, no related work has been found on understanding supply chain performance based on the network attributes of the disrupted supply chain entities. In this paper, we characterize supply chains from a capability and network topological perspective and investigate the use of a distributed decision-making approach based on classical multi-agent frameworks. The performance of the distributed framework is evaluated through a comprehensive case study that investigates the performance of the supply chain as a function of the network structure and agent attributes within the network in the presence of a disruption. Comparison to a centralized decision-making approach highlights trade-offs between performance, computation time, and network communication based on the decision-making strategy and network architecture. Practitioners can use the outcomes of our studies to design response strategies based on agent capabilities, network attributes, and desired supply chain performance."

However, existing benchmarks lack metrics for FD scenes, e.g., evaluating model performance during user interruptions. In this paper, we present a comprehensive FD benchmarking pipeline utilizing LLMs, TTS, and ASR to address this gap.

We applied our benchmark to three open-source FDSDS (Moshi, Freeze-omni, and VITA-1.5) using over 40 hours of generated speech, with 293 simulated conversations and 1,200 interruptions. The results show that all models continue to face challenges, such as failing to respond to user interruptions, under frequent disruptions and noisy conditions.

This selection process usually involves a brute-force approach: compiling the circuit on various devices and evaluating performance based on factors such as circuit depth and gate fidelity. However, this method is computationally expensive and does not scale well as the number of available quantum processors increases. In this work, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based predictor that automates hardware selection by analyzing the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) representation of a quantum circuit. Our study evaluates 498 quantum circuits (up to 27 qubits) from the MQT Bench dataset, compiled using Qiskit on four devices: three superconducting quantum processors (IBM-Kyiv, IBM-Brisbane, IBM-Sherbrooke) and one trapped-ion processor (IONQ-Forte). Performance is estimated using a metric that integrates circuit depth and gate fidelity, resulting in a dataset where 93 circuits are optimally compiled on the trapped-ion device, while the remaining circuits prefer superconducting platforms. By exploiting graph-based machine learning, our approach avoids extracting the circuit features for the model evaluation but directly embeds it as a graph, significantly accelerating the optimal target decision-making process and maintaining all the information. Experimental results prove 94.4% accuracy and an 85.5% F1 score for the minority class, effectively predicting the best compilation target.

Standard retrieval process prioritized relevance, focusing on topical alignment between queries and passages. In contrast, in RAG, the emphasis has shifted to utility, which considers the usefulness of passages for generating accurate answers. Despite empirical evidence showing the benefits of utility-based retrieval in RAG, the high computational cost of using LLMs for utility judgments limits the number of passages evaluated. This restriction is problematic for complex queries requiring extensive information. To address this, we propose a method to distill the utility judgment capabilities of LLMs into smaller, more efficient models. Our approach focuses on utility-based selection rather than ranking, enabling dynamic passage selection tailored to specific queries without the need for fixed thresholds. We train student models to learn pseudo-answer generation and utility judgments from teacher LLMs, using a sliding window method that dynamically selects useful passages. Our experiments demonstrate that utility-based selection provides a flexible and cost-effective solution for RAG, significantly reducing computational costs while improving answer quality. We present the distillation results using Qwen3-32B as the teacher model for both relevance ranking and utility-based selection, distilled into RankQwen1.7B and UtilityQwen1.7B. Our findings indicate that for complex questions, utility-based selection is more effective than relevance ranking in enhancing answer generation performance. We will release the relevance ranking and utility-based selection annotations for the MS MARCO dataset, supporting further research in this area."

Our \"gradient dropout\" selectively nullifies hidden layer neuron gradients with probability 1 - p during backpropagation, while keeping forward passes active. This is framed within compositional game theory. Additionally, target variables were perturbed with white noise or stable distributions. Experiments on ten diverse tabular datasets show varying impacts: improvement or diminishing of robustness and accuracy, depending on dataset and hyperparameters. Notably, on regression tasks, gradient dropout (p = 0.9) combined with stable distribution target noising significantly increased input noise robustness, evidenced by flatter MSE curves and more stable SMAPE values.

We introduce ReCoDe--Reinforcement-based Constraint Design--a decentralized, hybrid framework that merges the reliability of optimization-based controllers with the adaptability of multi-agent reinforcement learning. Rather than discarding expert controllers, ReCoDe improves them by learning additional, dynamic constraints that capture subtler behaviors, for example, by constraining agent movements to prevent congestion in cluttered scenarios. Through local communication, agents collectively constrain their allowed actions to coordinate more effectively under changing conditions. In this work, we focus on applications of ReCoDe to multi-agent navigation tasks requiring intricate, context-based movements and consensus, where we show that it outperforms purely handcrafted controllers, other hybrid approaches, and standard MARL baselines. We give empirical (real robot) and theoretical evidence that retaining a user-defined controller, even when it is imperfect, is more efficient than learning from scratch, especially because ReCoDe can dynamically change the degree to which it relies on this controller."

The main analytical tool is the samplet transform, originally defined in the Euclidean framework as a discrete wavelet-like construction, tailored to the analysis of scattered data. The first contribution of this work is defining samplets on graphs. To this end, we subdivide the graph into a fixed number of patches, embed each patch into a Euclidean space, where we construct samplets, and eventually pull the construction back to the graph. This ensures orthogonality, locality, and the vanishing moments property with respect to properly defined polynomial spaces on graphs. Compared to classical Haar wavelets, this framework broadens the class of graph signals that can efficiently be compressed and analyzed. Along this line, we provide a definition of a class of signals that can be compressed using our construction. We support our findings with different examples of signals defined on graphs whose vertices lie on smooth manifolds. For efficient numerical implementation, we combine heavy edge clustering, to partition the graph into meaningful patches, with landmark \\texttt{Isomap}, which provides low-dimensional embeddings for each patch. Our results demonstrate the method's robustness, scalability, and ability to yield sparse representations with controllable approximation error, significantly outperforming traditional Haar wavelet approaches in terms of compression efficiency and multiresolution fidelity."

Experimental results show that on the APTOS dataset, the DenseNet-169 yielded 83.20% mean accuracy, followed by the MobileNetV3-small and EfficientNet-b0, which yielded 82% and 80% accuracies, respectively. On the EYEPACS dataset, the EfficientNet-b0 yielded a mean accuracy of 80%, while the DenseNet-169 and MobileNetV3-small yielded 75.43% and 76.68% accuracies, respectively. In addition, we also compute the F1-score of 82.0%, precision of 82.1%, sensitivity of 83.0%, specificity of 95.5%, and a kappa score of 88.2% for the experiments. Moreover, in our work, the MobileNetV3-small has 1.6 million parameters on the APTOS dataset and 0.90 million parameters on the EYEPACS dataset, which is comparatively less than other methods. The proposed approach achieves competitive performance that is at par with recently reported works on DR classification."

The resulting hybrid sequence is decoded to produce audio that preserves the target's temporal structure while adopting the source's timbral characteristics. This technique requires no model training, works with diverse audio materials, and naturally avoids the discontinuities typical of traditional concatenative synthesis through the codec's implicit interpolation during decoding.

Prior work can be categorized into two frameworks. Bottom-up methods first determine boundaries and then cluster the fixed segmented words into a lexicon. In contrast, top-down methods incorporate information from the clustered words to inform boundary selection. However, it is unclear whether top-down information is necessary to improve segmentation. To explore this, we look at two similar approaches that differ in whether top-down clustering informs boundary selection. Our simple bottom-up strategy predicts word boundaries using the dissimilarity between adjacent self-supervised features, then clusters the resulting segments to construct a lexicon. Our top-down system is an updated version of the ES-KMeans dynamic programming method that iteratively uses K-means to update its boundaries. On the five-language ZeroSpeech benchmarks, both approaches achieve comparable state-of-the-art results, with the bottom-up system being nearly five times faster. Through detailed analyses, we show that the top-down influence of ES-KMeans can be beneficial (depending on factors like the candidate boundaries), but in many cases the simple bottom-up method performs just as well. For both methods, we show that the clustering step is a limiting factor. Therefore, we recommend that future work focus on improved clustering techniques and learning more discriminative word-like representations.

Our paper addresses this challenge by introducing knowledge grafting, a novel mechanism that optimizes AI models for resource-constrained environments by transferring selected features (the scion) from a large donor model to a smaller rootstock model. The approach achieves an 88.54% reduction in model size (from 64.39 MB to 7.38 MB), while improving generalization capability of the model. Our new rootstock model achieves 89.97% validation accuracy (vs. donor's 87.47%), maintains lower validation loss (0.2976 vs. 0.5068), and performs exceptionally well on unseen test data with 90.45% accuracy. It addresses the typical size vs performance trade-off, and enables deployment of AI frameworks on resource-constrained devices with enhanced performance. We have tested our approach on an agricultural weed detection scenario, however, it can be extended across various edge computing scenarios, potentially accelerating AI adoption in areas with limited hardware/software support -- by mirroring in a similar manner the horticultural grafting enables productive cultivation in challenging agri-based environments."

We propose prior knowledge-based augmentation strategies to enhance SAM2 for ART.\n  Methods: Two strategies were introduced to improve SAM2: (1) using prior MR images and annotations as contextual inputs, and (2) improving prompt robustness via random bounding box expansion and mask erosion/dilation. The resulting model, SAM2-Aug, was fine-tuned and tested on the One-Seq-Liver dataset (115 MRIs from 31 liver cancer patients), and evaluated without retraining on Mix-Seq-Abdomen (88 MRIs, 28 patients) and Mix-Seq-Brain (86 MRIs, 37 patients).\n  Results: SAM2-Aug outperformed convolutional, transformer-based, and prompt-driven models across all datasets, achieving Dice scores of 0.86(liver), 0.89(abdomen), and 0.90(brain). It demonstrated strong generalization across tumor types and imaging sequences, with improved performance in boundary-sensitive metrics.\n  Conclusions: Incorporating prior images and enhancing prompt diversity significantly boosts segmentation accuracy and generalizability.

Many existing researches focus on piecewise constant MS mesh segmentation model with total variation regularization, which pursue the shortest length of boundaries. Different from previous efforts, in this article, we propose a novel piecewise smooth MS mesh segmentation model by utilizing the relaxed total generalized variation regularization (rTGV). The new model assumes that the feature function of a mesh can be approximated by the sum of piecewise constant function and asmooth function, and the rTGV regularization is able to characterize the high order discontinuity of the geometric structure. The newly introduced method is effective in segmenting meshes with irregular structures and getting the better boundaries rather than the shortest boundaries. We solve the new model by alternating minimization and alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Our algorithm is discussed from several aspects, and comparisons with several state-of-art methods. Experimental results show that our method can yield competitive results when compared to other approaches. In addition, our results compare favorably to those of the several state-of-art techniques when evaluated on the Princeton Segmentation Benchmark. Furthermore, the quantitative errors and computational costs confirm the robustness and efficiency of the proposed method."

This problem is of central importance to algorithms across scientific computing and machine learning, with applications to fast multiplication and inversion for structured matrices, building preconditioners for first-order optimization, and as a model for differential operator learning. Prior work focuses on obtaining query complexity upper and lower bounds for learning specific structured matrix families that commonly arise in applications.\n  We initiate the study of the problem in greater generality, aiming to understand the query complexity of learning approximations from general matrix families. Our main result focuses on finding a near-optimal approximation to $A$ from any finite-sized family of matrices, $\\mathcal{F}$. Standard results from matrix sketching show that $O(\\log|\\mathcal{F}|)$ matvec queries suffice in this setting. This bound can also be achieved, and is optimal, for vector-matrix-vector queries of the form $x,y\\rightarrow x^TAy$, which have been widely studied in work on rank-$1$ matrix sensing.\n  Surprisingly, we show that, in the matvec model, it is possible to obtain a nearly quadratic improvement in complexity, to $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{\\log|\\mathcal{F}|})$. Further, we prove that this bound is tight up to log-log factors.Via covering number arguments, our result extends to well-studied infinite families. As an example, we establish that a near-optimal approximation from any \\emph{linear matrix family} of dimension $q$ can be learned with $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{q})$ matvec queries, improving on an $O(q)$ bound achievable via sketching techniques and vector-matrix-vector queries."

These resources, unlike high-purity South American brines, require innovative purification techniques to be economically viable. Continuous crystallization is a promising method for producing battery-grade lithium carbonate, but its optimization is challenged by a complex parameter space and limited data. This study introduces a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) assisted active learning framework to optimize the continuous crystallization of lithium carbonate. By integrating human expertise with data-driven insights, our approach accelerates the optimization of lithium extraction from challenging sources. Our results demonstrate the framework's ability to rapidly adapt to new data, significantly improving the process's tolerance to critical impurities like magnesium from the industry standard of a few hundred ppm to as high as 6000 ppm. This breakthrough makes the exploitation of low-grade, impurity-rich lithium resources feasible, potentially reducing the need for extensive pre-refinement processes. By leveraging artificial intelligence, we have refined operational parameters and demonstrated that lower-grade materials can be used without sacrificing product quality.

Enhancing LLMs' robustness to such noise is critical for improving the reliability of RAG systems. Recent advances have equipped LLMs with strong reasoning and self-reflection capabilities, allowing them to identify and correct errors in their reasoning process. Inspired by this ability, we propose Passage Injection-a simple yet effective method that explicitly incorporates retrieved passages into LLMs' reasoning process, aiming to enhance the model's ability to recognize and resist noisy passages. We validate Passage Injection under general RAG settings using BM25 as the retriever. Experiments on four reasoning-enhanced LLMs across four factual QA datasets demonstrate that Passage Injection significantly improves overall RAG performance. Further analysis on two noisy retrieval settings-random noise, where the model is provided irrelevant passages, and counterfactual noise, where it is given misleading passages-shows that Passage Injection consistently improves robustness. Controlled experiments confirm that Passage Injection can also effectively leverage helpful passages. These findings suggest that incorporating passages in LLMs' reasoning process is a promising direction for building more robust RAG systems.

This setting includes majority of multilayer network models as its particular cases. The key task in this model is to recover the groups of layers with unique subspace structures, since the case where all layers of the network are embedded in the same subspace has been fairly well studied. Until now, clustering of layers in such networks was based on the layer-per-layer analysis, which required the multilayer network to be sufficiently dense.

This paper proposes a Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning methodology specifically tailored to multi-year infrastructure planning. Our approach decomposes the problem into two hierarchical levels: a high-level Budget Planner allocating annual budgets within explicit feasibility bounds, and a low-level Maintenance Planner prioritizing assets within the allocated budget. By structurally separating macro-budget decisions from asset-level prioritization and integrating linear programming projection within a hierarchical Soft Actor-Critic framework, the method efficiently addresses exponential growth in the action space and ensures rigorous budget compliance. A case study evaluating sewer networks of varying sizes (10, 15, and 20 sewersheds) illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Content-based approaches, which leverage item metadata, are commonly used in such scenarios. One possible way is to use embeddings derived from content features such as textual descriptions as initialization for the model embeddings. However, directly using frozen content embeddings often results in suboptimal performance, as they may not fully adapt to the recommendation task. On the other hand, fine-tuning these embeddings can degrade performance for cold-start items, as item representations may drift far from their original structure after training. We propose a novel approach to address this limitation. Instead of entirely freezing the content embeddings or fine-tuning them extensively, we introduce a small trainable delta to frozen embeddings that enables the model to adapt item representations without letting them go too far from their original semantic structure. This approach demonstrates consistent improvements across multiple datasets and modalities, including e-commerce datasets with textual descriptions and a music dataset with audio-based representation."

A control prototype was implemented using a depth sensor with four laser scanners. Vibrotactile feedback was also designed to help users to correctly aim the sensor at target objects. Ten able-bodied volunteers used a prosthesis equipped with the novel controller to grasp ten objects of varying shapes, sizes, and orientations. For comparison, they also tested an existing benchmark controller that used full-depth information. The results showed that the novel controller handled all objects and, while performance improved with training, it remained slightly below that of the benchmark. This marks an important step towards a compact vision-based system for embedded depth sensing in prosthesis grasping."

Similar to KRnet, B-KRnet consists of a series of coupling layers with progressively fewer active transformation dimensions, inspired by the triangular structure of the Knothe-Rosenblatt (KR) rearrangement. The main difference between B-KRnet and KRnet is that B-KRnet is defined on a hypercube while KRnet is defined on the whole space, in other words, a new mechanism is introduced in B-KRnet to maintain the exact invertibility. Using B-KRnet as a transport map, we obtain an explicit probability density function (PDF) model that corresponds to the pushforward of a base (uniform) distribution on the hypercube. It can be directly applied to density estimation when only data are available. By coupling KRnet and B-KRnet, we define a deep generative model on a high-dimensional domain where some dimensions are bounded and other dimensions are unbounded. A typical case is the solution of the stationary kinetic Fokker-Planck equation, which is a PDF of position and momentum. Based on B-KRnet, we develop an adaptive learning approach to approximate partial differential equations whose solutions are PDFs or can be treated as PDFs. A variety of numerical experiments is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of B-KRnet."

This idea is primarily inspired by the improved generalization capability induced by solving multiple tasks simultaneously, which leads to a more robust shared representation. Nevertheless, finding optimal auxiliary tasks is a crucial problem that often requires hand-crafted solutions or expensive meta-learning approaches. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, dubbed Detaux, whereby a weakly supervised disentanglement procedure is used to discover a new unrelated auxiliary classification task, which allows us to go from a Single-Task Learning (STL) to a Multi-Task Learning (MTL) problem. The disentanglement procedure works at the representation level, isolating the variation related to the principal task into an isolated subspace and additionally producing an arbitrary number of orthogonal subspaces, each of which encourages high separability among projections. We generate the auxiliary classification task through a clustering procedure on the most disentangled subspace, obtaining a discrete set of labels. Subsequently, the original data, the labels associated with the principal task, and the newly discovered ones can be fed into any MTL framework. Experimental validation on both synthetic and real data, along with various ablation studies, demonstrates promising results, revealing the potential in what has been, so far, an unexplored connection between learning disentangled representations and MTL.

In this paper, we aim to compare three prevailing paradigms for E2ERE using a complex dataset focused on rare diseases involving discontinuous and nested entities. We use the RareDis information extraction dataset to evaluate three competing approaches (for E2ERE): NER $\\rightarrow$ RE pipelines, joint sequence to sequence models, and generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models. We use comparable state-of-the-art models and best practices for each of these approaches and conduct error analyses to assess their failure modes. Our findings reveal that pipeline models are still the best, while sequence-to-sequence models are not far behind; GPT models with eight times as many parameters are worse than even sequence-to-sequence models and lose to pipeline models by over 10 F1 points. Partial matches and discontinuous entities caused many NER errors contributing to lower overall E2E performances. We also verify these findings on a second E2ERE dataset for chemical-protein interactions. Although generative LM-based methods are more suitable for zero-shot settings, when training data is available, our results show that it is better to work with more conventional models trained and tailored for E2ERE. More innovative methods are needed to marry the best of the both worlds from smaller encoder-decoder pipeline models and the larger GPT models to improve E2ERE. As of now, we see that well designed pipeline models offer substantial performance gains at a lower cost and carbon footprint for E2ERE. Our contribution is also the first to conduct E2ERE for the RareDis dataset."

Based on the assumption that the loss spike is caused by the sudden growth of the gradient norm, we explore factors to keep the gradient norm small through an analysis of the spectral norms of the Jacobian matrices for the sub-layers. Our findings suggest that stabilizing the pre-training process requires two conditions: small sub-layers and large shortcut. We conduct various experiments to empirically verify our theoretical analyses.

Conventional learning approaches often target the problem in the classical multi-class or multilabel classification setting. This setting hinders the learning ability of the model due to a large number of classes (i.e., TTPs), the inevitable skewness of the label distribution and the complex hierarchical structure of the label space. We formulate the problem in a different learning paradigm, where the assignment of a text to a TTP label is decided by the direct semantic similarity between the two, thus reducing the complexity of competing solely over the large labeling space. To that end, we propose a neural matching architecture with an effective sampling-based learn-to-compare mechanism, facilitating the learning process of the matching model despite constrained resources."

The past few years have seen generative language models (LMs), instruction finetuning, and few-shot learning become foci of NLP research. As such, generative LMs pretrained on biomedical corpora have proliferated and biomedical instruction finetuning has been attempted as well, all with the hope that domain specificity improves performance on downstream tasks. Given the nontrivial effort in training such models, we investigate what, if any, benefits they have in the key biomedical NLP task of relation extraction. Specifically, we address two questions: (1) Do LMs trained on biomedical corpora outperform those trained on general domain corpora? (2) Do models instruction finetuned on biomedical datasets outperform those finetuned on assorted datasets or those simply pretrained? We tackle these questions using existing LMs, testing across four datasets. In a surprising result, general-domain models typically outperformed biomedical-domain models. However, biomedical instruction finetuning improved performance to a similar degree as general instruction finetuning, despite having orders of magnitude fewer instructions. Our findings suggest it may be more fruitful to focus research effort on larger-scale biomedical instruction finetuning of general LMs over building domain-specific biomedical LMs"

Our approach integrates domain-specific feature groupings, carefully balanced few-shot examples, and task-specific prompting strategies. We systematically evaluate this method across seventy distinct ICL designs by various prompt variations and two different communication styles-natural-language narrative and numeric conversational-and compare its performance to robust classical machine learning (ML) benchmarks on tasks involving heart disease and diabetes prediction.\n  Our findings indicate that while traditional ML models maintain superior performance in balanced precision-recall scenarios, LLMs employing narrative prompts with integrated domain knowledge achieve higher recall and significantly reduce gender bias, effectively narrowing fairness disparities by an order of magnitude. Despite the current limitation of increased inference latency, LLMs provide notable advantages, including the capacity for zero-shot deployment and enhanced equity.

In this paper, we introduce MagicDrive3D, a novel framework for controllable 3D street scene generation that combines video-based view synthesis with 3D representation (3DGS) generation. It supports multi-condition control, including road maps, 3D objects, and text descriptions.

This method utilizes routinely collected autonomous driving data, reducing data acquisition challenges and enriching 3D scene generation. In the 3DGS generation step, we introduce Fault-Tolerant Gaussian Splatting to address minor errors and use monocular depth for better initialization, alongside appearance modeling to manage exposure discrepancies across viewpoints. Experiments show that MagicDrive3D generates diverse, high-quality 3D driving scenes, supports any-view rendering, and enhances downstream tasks like BEV segmentation, demonstrating its potential for autonomous driving simulation and beyond."

This paper introduces \\textbf{HumorDB}, a novel, controlled, and carefully curated dataset designed to evaluate and advance visual humor understanding by AI systems. The dataset comprises diverse images spanning photos, cartoons, sketches, and AI-generated content, including minimally contrastive pairs where subtle edits differentiate between humorous and non-humorous versions. We evaluate humans, state-of-the-art vision models, and large vision-language models on three tasks: binary humor classification, funniness rating prediction, and pairwise humor comparison. The results reveal a gap between current AI systems and human-level humor understanding. While pretrained vision-language models perform better than vision-only models, they still struggle with abstract sketches and subtle humor cues. Analysis of attention maps shows that even when models correctly classify humorous images, they often fail to focus on the precise regions that make the image funny. Preliminary mechanistic interpretability studies and evaluation of model explanations provide initial insights into how different architectures process humor. Our results identify promising trends and current limitations, suggesting that an effective understanding of visual humor requires sophisticated architectures capable of detecting subtle contextual features and bridging the gap between visual perception and abstract reasoning.

In this work we explore a simple, effective adaptive inference technique we term Agreement-Based Cascading (ABC). ABC builds a cascade of models of increasing size/complexity, and uses agreement between ensembles of models at each level of the cascade as a basis for data-dependent routing. Although ensemble execution introduces additional expense, we show that these costs can be easily offset in practice due to large expected differences in model sizes, parallel inference execution capabilities, and accuracy benefits of ensembling. We examine ABC theoretically and empirically in terms of these parameters, showing that the approach can reliably act as a drop-in replacement for existing models and surpass the best single model it aims to replace in terms of both efficiency and accuracy. Additionally, we explore the performance of ABC relative to existing cascading methods in three common scenarios: (1) edge-to-cloud inference, where ABC reduces communication costs by up to 14x; (2) cloud-based model serving, where it achieves a 3x reduction in rental costs; and (3) inference via model API services, where ABC achieves a 2-25x reduction in average price per token/request relative to state-of-the-art LLM cascades."

However, the issue of lacking controllability of such models restricts their practical applicability for real-life content creation. Thus, attention has been focused on leveraging a reference image to control text-to-image synthesis, which is also regarded as manipulating (or editing) a reference image as per a text prompt, namely, text-driven image-to-image translation. This paper contributes a novel, concise, and efficient approach that adapts pre-trained large-scale text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model to the image-to-image (I2I) paradigm in a plug-and-play manner, realizing high-quality and versatile text-driven I2I translation without any model training, model fine-tuning, or online optimization process. To guide T2I generation with a reference image, we propose to decompose diverse guiding factors with different frequency bands of diffusion features in the DCT spectral space, and accordingly devise a novel frequency band substitution layer which realizes dynamic control of the reference image to the T2I generation result in a plug-and-play manner. We demonstrate that our method allows flexible control over both guiding factor and guiding intensity of the reference image simply by tuning the type and bandwidth of the substituted frequency band, respectively. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments verify superiority of our approach over related methods in I2I translation visual quality, versatility, and controllability.

However, a critical gap remains between artificial intelligence's computational capabilities and researchers' intuitive goals, particularly in using natural language to bridge complex tasks with human intentions. Large language models have shown potential to interpret human intentions, yet their application to biomolecular research remains nascent due to challenges including specialized knowledge requirements, multimodal data integration, and semantic alignment between natural language and biomolecules. To address these limitations, we present InstructBioMol, a large language model designed to bridge natural language and biomolecules through a comprehensive any-to-any alignment of natural language, molecules and proteins. This model can integrate multimodal biomolecules as the input, and enable researchers to articulate design goals in natural language, providing biomolecular outputs that meet precise biological needs. Experimental results demonstrate that InstructBioMol can understand and design biomolecules following human instructions. In particular, it can generate drug molecules with a 10% improvement in binding affinity and design enzymes that achieve an enzyme-substrate pair prediction score of 70.4.

To address these challenges, we propose MaskControl, the first approach to introduce controllability to the generative masked motion model. Our approach introduces two key innovations. First, \\textit{Logits Regularizer} implicitly perturbs logits at training time to align the distribution of motion tokens with the controlled joint positions, while regularizing the categorical token prediction to ensure high-fidelity generation. Second, \\textit{Logit Optimization} explicitly optimizes the predicted logits during inference time, directly reshaping the token distribution that forces the generated motion to accurately align with the controlled joint positions. Moreover, we introduce \\textit{Differentiable Expectation Sampling (DES)} to combat the non-differential distribution sampling process encountered by logits regularizer and optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MaskControl outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior motion quality (FID decreases by ~77\\%) and higher control precision (average error 0.91 vs. 1.08).

Since an information cascade process is essentially a propagation tree, recent rumor detection models leverage graph neural networks to additionally capture information propagation patterns, thus outperforming text-only solutions. Given the variations in topics and social impact of the root node, different source information naturally has distinct outreach capabilities, resulting in different heights of propagation trees. This variation, however, impedes the data-driven design of existing graph-based rumor detectors. Given a shallow propagation tree with limited interactions, it is unlikely for graph-based approaches to capture sufficient cascading patterns, questioning their ability to handle less popular news or early detection needs. In contrast, a deep propagation tree is prone to noisy user responses, and this can in turn obfuscate the predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel Epidemiology-informed Network (EIN) that integrates epidemiological knowledge to enhance performance by overcoming data-driven methods sensitivity to data quality. Meanwhile, to adapt epidemiology theory to rumor detection, it is expected that each users stance toward the source information will be annotated. To bypass the costly and time-consuming human labeling process, we take advantage of large language models to generate stance labels, facilitating optimization objectives for learning epidemiology-informed representations. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed EIN not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods on real-world datasets but also exhibits enhanced robustness across varying tree depths."

In this work, we propose Verbalized Representation Learning (VRL), a novel approach for automatically extracting human-interpretable features for object recognition using few-shot data. Our method uniquely captures inter-class differences and intra-class commonalities in the form of natural language by employing a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to identify key discriminative features between different classes and shared characteristics within the same class. These verbalized features are then mapped to numeric vectors through the VLM. The resulting feature vectors can be further utilized to train and infer with downstream classifiers. Experimental results show that, at the same model scale, VRL achieves a 24% absolute improvement over prior state-of-the-art methods while using 95% less data and a smaller mode. Furthermore, compared to human-labeled attributes, the features learned by VRL exhibit a 20% absolute gain when used for downstream classification tasks.

While numerous segmentation models have been proposed, most operate on a single image (view), making them impractical for cross-view scenarios. PSALM, a recently proposed segmentation method, stands out as a notable exception with its demonstrated zero-shot ability on this task. However, due to the drastic viewpoint change between ego and exo, PSALM fails to accurately locate and segment objects, especially in complex backgrounds or when object appearances change significantly. To address these issues, we propose ObjectRelator, a novel approach featuring two key modules: Multimodal Condition Fusion (MCFuse) and SSL-based Cross-View Object Alignment (XObjAlign). MCFuse introduces language as an additional cue, integrating both visual masks and textual descriptions to improve object localization and prevent incorrect associations. XObjAlign enforces cross-view consistency through self-supervised alignment, enhancing robustness to object appearance variations. Extensive experiments demonstrate ObjectRelator's effectiveness on the large-scale Ego-Exo4D benchmark and HANDAL-X (an adapted dataset for cross-view segmentation) with state-of-the-art performance.

(ii) Intra-modality modeling then comes to play. (iii) Multimodal reasoning} resumes and lasts until the end of inference. In particular, we reveal that visual tokens will stop contributing to reasoning when the text tokens receive enough image information, yielding obvious visual redundancy. Based on these generalized observations, we propose a simple yet effective method to improve the efficiency of MLLMs, termed dynamic visual-token exit (DyVTE). DyVTE uses lightweight hyper-networks to perceive the text token status and decide the removal of all visual tokens after a certain layer, thereby addressing the observed visual redundancy. To validate VTE, we apply it to a set of MLLMs, including LLaVA, VILA, Eagle and InternVL, and conduct extensive experiments on a bunch of benchmarks. The experiment results not only show the effectiveness of our VTE in improving MLLMs' efficiency, but also yield the general modeling patterns of MLLMs, well facilitating the in-depth understanding of MLLMs. Our code is released at https://github.com/DoubtedSteam/DyVTE."

Existing natural image augmentations for reflected light imaging neglect the data characteristics of X-ray security images. Moreover, prior X-ray augmentation methods have predominantly focused on foreground prohibited items, overlooking informative background cues. In this paper, we propose Background Mixup (BGM), a background-based augmentation technique tailored for X-ray security imaging domain. Unlike conventional methods, BGM is founded on an in-depth analysis of physical properties including: 1) X-ray Transmission Imagery: Transmitted X-ray pixels represent composite information from multiple materials along the imaging path. 2) Material-based Pseudo-coloring: Pseudo-coloring in X-ray images correlates directly with material properties, aiding in material distinction. Building upon the above insights, BGM mixes background patches across regions on both 1) texture structure and 2) material variation, to benefit models from complicated background cues. This enhances the model's capability to handle domain-specific challenges such as occlusion-induced discriminative imbalance. Importantly, BGM is orthogonal and fully compatible with existing foreground-focused augmentation techniques, enabling joint use to further enhance detection performance. Extensive experiments on multiple X-ray security benchmarks show that BGM consistently surpasses strong baselines, without additional annotations or significant training overhead. This work pioneers the exploration of background-aware augmentation in X-ray prohibited items detection and provides a lightweight, plug-and-play solution with broad applicability."

One stream of this type of research investigates the knowledge that PLMs have about semantic relations. However, many aspects of semantic relations were left unexplored. Generally, only one relation has been considered, namely hypernymy. Furthermore, previous work did not measure humans' performance on the same task as that performed by the PLMs. This means that at this point in time, there is only an incomplete view of the extent of these models' semantic relation knowledge. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation framework covering five relations beyond hypernymy, namely hyponymy, holonymy, meronymy, antonymy, and synonymy. We use five metrics (two newly introduced here) for recently untreated aspects of semantic relation knowledge, namely soundness, completeness, symmetry, prototypicality, and distinguishability. Using these, we can fairly compare humans and models on the same task. Our extensive experiments involve six PLMs, four masked and two causal language models. The results reveal a significant knowledge gap between humans and models for all semantic relations. In general, causal language models, despite their wide use, do not always perform significantly better than masked language models. Antonymy is the outlier relation where all models perform reasonably well."

Anomalies that only exist in one modality may not be effectively captured in the fused teacher features, leading to detection failures. Besides, these methods do not fully leverage the rich intra- and inter-modality information that are critical for effective anomaly detection. In this paper, we propose Tuned Reverse Distillation (TRD) based on Multi-branch design to realize Multimodal Industrial AD. By assigning independent branches to each modality, our method enables finer detection of anomalies within each modality. Furthermore, we enhance the interaction between modalities during the distillation process by designing two Crossmodal Tuners including Crossmodal Filter and Amplifier. With the idea of crossmodal mapping, the student network is allowed to better learn normal features while anomalies in all modalities are ensured to be effectively detected.

Recent development of neural fields brings in level-set parameters from signed distance functions as a novel, continuous, and numerical representation of 3D shapes, where the shape surfaces are defined as zero-level-sets of those functions. This motivates us to extend shape analysis from the traditional 3D data to these novel parameter data. Since the level-set parameters are not Euclidean like point clouds, we establish correlations across different shapes by formulating them as a pseudo-normal distribution, and learn the distribution prior from the respective dataset. To further explore the level-set parameters with shape transformations, we propose to condition a subset of these parameters on rotations and translations, and generate them with a hypernetwork. This simplifies the pose-related shape analysis compared to using traditional data. We demonstrate the promise of the novel representations through applications in shape classification (arbitrary poses), retrieval, and 6D object pose estimation."

We further explore whether the LLMs can reliably meta-evaluate the personalization quality and whether the personalization affects the generated-texts detectability. Our results demonstrate the need for stronger safety-filters and disclaimers, as those are not properly functioning in most of the evaluated LLMs. Additionally, our study revealed that the personalization actually reduces the safety-filter activations; thus effectively functioning as a jailbreak.

In order to increase the frequency of such observations, \"potential-based reward shaping\" (PBRS) has been proposed as a method of providing a more dense reward signal while leaving the optimal policy invariant. However, the required \"potential function\" must be carefully designed with task-dependent knowledge to not deter training performance. In this work, we propose a \"bootstrapped\" method of reward shaping, termed BSRS, in which the agent's current estimate of the state-value function acts as the potential function for PBRS. We provide convergence proofs for the tabular setting, give insights into training dynamics for deep RL, and show that the proposed method improves training speed in the Atari suite."

Existing token reduction methods primarily prune tokens based on importance metrics, such as cumulative attention scores. However, even important tokens may exhibit high redundancy caused by similarity among adjacent video frames and repetitive visual elements. To address this limitation, we propose FrameFusion, a novel token reduction approach integrating similarity-based merging with importance-based pruning. We conduct a thorough study on token similarity characteristics, revealing three key insights: (1) spatially corresponding visual tokens between adjacent frames have higher cosine similarities compared to other token pairs; (2) high token similarities prominently decrease in deeper model layers; and (3) token similarity rankings are highly consistent across different layers. Guided by these observations, FrameFusion computes token similarities exclusively between corresponding visual tokens from adjacent frames, applies token merging at initial successive layers followed by pruning in deeper layers, and adopts a cascaded merging strategy to further enhance efficiency. We evaluate FrameFusion comprehensively across six diverse LVLMs, ranging from 2B to 72B parameters, using five video benchmarks encompassing video retrieval, question-answering, and spatial-temporal understanding tasks. Experiments show that FrameFusion reduces visual tokens by 70%, achieving 1.6-3.6x end-to-end speedups, with an average performance impact of less than 3%.

While some efforts have been made to evaluate models on specific safety dimensions, many critical risks remain unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce T2ISafety, a safety benchmark that evaluates T2I models across three key domains: toxicity, fairness, and bias. We build a detailed hierarchy of 12 tasks and 44 categories based on these three domains, and meticulously collect 70K corresponding prompts. Based on this taxonomy and prompt set, we build a large-scale T2I dataset with 68K manually annotated images and train an evaluator capable of detecting critical risks that previous work has failed to identify, including risks that even ultra-large proprietary models like GPTs cannot correctly detect. We evaluate 12 prominent diffusion models on T2ISafety and reveal several concerns including persistent issues with racial fairness, a tendency to generate toxic content, and significant variation in privacy protection across the models, even with defense methods like concept erasing.

However, there are concerns about the gender bias of these models. Previous studies have shown that T2I models can perpetuate or even amplify gender stereotypes when provided with neutral text prompts. Researchers have proposed automated gender bias uncovering detectors for T2I models, but a crucial gap exists: no existing work comprehensively compares the various detectors and understands how the gender bias detected by them deviates from the actual situation. This study addresses this gap by validating previous gender bias detectors using a manually labeled dataset and comparing how the bias identified by various detectors deviates from the actual bias in T2I models, as verified by manual confirmation. We create a dataset consisting of 6,000 images generated from three cutting-edge T2I models: Stable Diffusion XL, Stable Diffusion 3, and Dreamlike Photoreal 2.0. During the human-labeling process, we find that all three T2I models generate a portion (12.48% on average) of low-quality images (e.g., generate images with no face present), where human annotators cannot determine the gender of the person. Our analysis reveals that all three T2I models show a preference for generating male images, with SDXL being the most biased. Additionally, images generated using prompts containing professional descriptions (e.g., lawyer or doctor) show the most bias. We evaluate seven gender bias detectors and find that none fully capture the actual level of bias in T2I models, with some detectors overestimating bias by up to 26.95%. We further investigate the causes of inaccurate estimations, highlighting the limitations of detectors in dealing with low-quality images. Based on our findings, we propose an enhanced detector..."

We then investigate the emerging properties of these highly clustered models. We find our trained clustered models do not exhibit more task specialization, but do form smaller circuits.

However, scaling demands predictability: we want methods to not only perform well with more compute or data, but also have their performance be predictable from small-scale runs, without running the large-scale experiment. In this paper, we show that value-based off-policy RL methods are predictable despite community lore regarding their pathological behavior. First, we show that data and compute requirements to attain a given performance level lie on a Pareto frontier, controlled by the updates-to-data (UTD) ratio. By estimating this frontier, we can predict this data requirement when given more compute, and this compute requirement when given more data. Second, we determine the optimal allocation of a total resource budget across data and compute for a given performance and use it to determine hyperparameters that maximize performance for a given budget. Third, this scaling is enabled by first estimating predictable relationships between hyperparameters, which is used to manage effects of overfitting and plasticity loss unique to RL. We validate our approach using three algorithms: SAC, BRO, and PQL on DeepMind Control, OpenAI gym, and IsaacGym, when extrapolating to higher levels of data, compute, budget, or performance."

In settings involving many students or an existing teacher, distillation outperforms supervised learning up to a compute level that scales predictably with student size. Conversely, if only one student is to be distilled and a teacher also requires training, supervised learning is generally preferable. Additionally, our large-scale study of distillation increases our understanding of the process and helps inform experimental design."

The body center of mass (COM) acceleration reflects the movements of the whole body and thus serves as a good predictor for PAEE. However, the wrist has also become a popular location due to recent advancements in wrist-worn devices. Therefore, in this work, using the respiratory data measured by COSMED K5 as the reference, we evaluated and compared the performances of COM-based settings and wrist-based settings. The COM-based settings include two different accelerometer compositions, using only the pelvis accelerometer (pelvis-acc) and the pelvis accelerometer with two accelerometers from two thighs (3-acc). The wrist-based settings include using only the left wrist accelerometer (l-wrist-acc) and only the right wrist accelerometer (r-wrist-acc). We implemented two existing PAEE estimation methods on our collected dataset, where 9 participants performed activities of daily living while wearing 5 accelerometers (i.e., pelvis, two thighs, and two wrists). These two methods include a linear regression (LR) model and a CNN-LSTM model. Both models yielded the best results with the COM-based 3-acc setting (LR: $R^2$ = 0.41, CNN-LSTM: $R^2$ = 0.53). No significant difference was found between the 3-acc and pelvis-acc settings (p-value = 0.278). For both models, neither the l-wrist-acc nor the r-wrist-acc settings demonstrated predictive power on PAEE with $R^2$ values close to 0, significantly outperformed by the two COM-based settings (p-values $<$ 0.05).

In this work, we develop a new SpFT framework, based on ideas from neural network pruning.

Here, we find that MultKAN layers suffer from a few key drawbacks including limited applicability in output layers, bulky parameterizations with extraneous activations, and the inclusion of complex hyperparameters. To address these issues, we propose LeanKANs, a direct and modular replacement for MultKAN and traditional AddKAN layers. LeanKANs address these three drawbacks of MultKAN through general applicability as output layers, significantly reduced parameter counts for a given network structure, and a smaller set of hyperparameters. As a one-to-one layer replacement for standard AddKAN and MultKAN layers, LeanKAN is able to provide these benefits to traditional KAN learning problems as well as augmented KAN structures in which it serves as the backbone, such as KAN Ordinary Differential Equations (KAN-ODEs) or Deep Operator KANs (DeepOKAN). We demonstrate LeanKAN's simplicity and efficiency in a series of demonstrations carried out across a standard KAN toy problem as well as ordinary and partial differential equations learned via KAN-ODEs, where we find that its sparser parameterization and compact structure serve to increase its expressivity and learning capability, leading it to outperform similar and even much larger MultKANs in various tasks."

However, existing generative methods typically treat EHRs as flat sequences of discrete medical codes. This approach overlooks two critical aspects: the inherent hierarchical organization of clinical coding systems and the rich semantic context provided by code descriptions. Consequently, synthetic patient sequences often lack high clinical fidelity and have limited utility in downstream clinical tasks. In this paper, we propose the Hierarchy- and Semantics-Guided Transformer (HiSGT), a novel framework that leverages both hierarchical and semantic information for the generative process. HiSGT constructs a hierarchical graph to encode parent-child and sibling relationships among clinical codes and employs a graph neural network to derive hierarchy-aware embeddings. These are then fused with semantic embeddings extracted from a pre-trained clinical language model (e.g., ClinicalBERT), enabling the Transformer-based generator to more accurately model the nuanced clinical patterns inherent in real EHRs. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets demonstrate that HiSGT significantly improves the statistical alignment of synthetic data with real patient records, as well as supports robust downstream applications such as chronic disease classification. By addressing the limitations of conventional raw code-based generative models, HiSGT represents a significant step toward clinically high-fidelity synthetic data generation and a general paradigm suitable for interpretable medical code representation, offering valuable applications in data augmentation and privacy-preserving healthcare analytics."

We believe that the pursuit of overall accuracy should not come from enriching the strong classes, but from raising up the weak ones. To address the imbalance, we propose a Heaviside step function based ensemble debiasing method, which enables flexible rectifications of in-context learned class probabilities at both class and sample levels. Evaluations with Llama-2-13B on seven text classification benchmarks show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art overall accuracy gains with balanced class accuracies. More importantly, we perform analyses on the resulted probability correction scheme, showing that sample-level corrections are necessary to elevate weak classes. Due to effectively correcting weak classes, our method also brings significant performance gains to a larger model variant, Llama-2-70B, especially on a biomedical domain task, further demonstrating the necessity of ensemble debiasing at both levels.

However, in practice, designing rewards is difficult, and even when specified, evaluating their correctness is equally problematic: how do we know if a reward function is correctly specified? In our work, we address these challenges by focusing on reward alignment -- assessing whether a reward function accurately encodes the preferences of a human stakeholder. As a concrete measure of reward alignment, we introduce the Trajectory Alignment Coefficient to quantify the similarity between a human stakeholder's ranking of trajectory distributions and those induced by a given reward function. We show that the Trajectory Alignment Coefficient exhibits desirable properties, such as not requiring access to a ground truth reward, invariance to potential-based reward shaping, and applicability to online RL. Additionally, in an 11 -- person user study of RL practitioners, we found that access to the Trajectory Alignment Coefficient during reward selection led to statistically significant improvements. Compared to relying only on reward functions, our metric reduced cognitive workload by 1.5x, was preferred by 82% of users and increased the success rate of selecting reward functions that produced performant policies by 41%."

In this work, we present a novel Traffic-Aware Radar Scene-Flow (TARS) estimation method, which utilizes motion rigidity at the traffic level. To address the challenges in radar scene flow, we perform object detection and scene flow jointly and boost the latter. We incorporate the feature map from the object detector, trained with detection losses, to make radar scene flow aware of the environment and road users. From this, we construct a Traffic Vector Field (TVF) in the feature space to achieve holistic traffic-level scene understanding in our scene flow branch. When estimating the scene flow, we consider both point-level motion cues from point neighbors and traffic-level consistency of rigid motion within the space. TARS outperforms the state of the art on a proprietary dataset and the View-of-Delft dataset, improving the benchmarks by 23% and 15%, respectively."

To significantly enhance roadside collaborative perception and address critical data issues, we present the first simulation framework RoCo-Sim for road-side collaborative perception. RoCo-Sim is capable of generating diverse, multi-view consistent simulated roadside data through dynamic foreground editing and full-scene style transfer of a single image. RoCo-Sim consists of four components: (1) Camera Extrinsic Optimization ensures accurate 3D to 2D projection for roadside cameras; (2) A novel Multi-View Occlusion-Aware Sampler (MOAS) determines the placement of diverse digital assets within 3D space; (3) DepthSAM innovatively models foreground-background relationships from single-frame fixed-view images, ensuring multi-view consistency of foreground; and (4) Scalable Post-Processing Toolkit generates more realistic and enriched scenes through style transfer and other enhancements. RoCo-Sim significantly improves roadside 3D object detection, outperforming SOTA methods by 83.74 on Rcooper-Intersection and 83.12 on TUMTraf-V2X for AP70.

Federated learning offers a privacy-friendly solution, but general FL frameworks often struggle with low-level vision tasks, resulting in blurry, low-quality outputs. To address this, we introduce FedVSR, the first FL framework specifically designed for VSR. It is model-agnostic and stateless, and introduces a lightweight loss function based on the DWT to better preserve high-frequency details during local training. Additionally, a loss-aware aggregation strategy combines both DWT-based and task-specific losses to guide global updates effectively. Extensive experiments across multiple VSR models and datasets demonstrate that FedVSR consistently outperforms existing FL methods, achieving up to 0.82 dB higher PSNR, 0.0327 higher SSIM, and 0.0251 lower LPIPS. These results underscore FedVSR's ability to bridge the gap between privacy and performance, setting a new benchmark for federated learning in low-level vision tasks.

We introduce SceneMI, a framework that supports several practical applications, including keyframe-guided character animation in 3D scenes and enhancing the motion quality of imperfect HSI data. SceneMI employs dual scene descriptors to comprehensively encode global and local scene context. Furthermore, our framework leverages the inherent denoising nature of diffusion models to generalize on noisy keyframes.

To better understand the dynamics of information circulation and the emergence of information voids we propose a model that takes into account the supply and demand of information related to the Italian climate-transition discourse.

Our findings highlight responsiveness and temporal coupling between supply and demand, particularly during moments of heightened public attention triggered by significant external events.

Fine-tuning adapts pre-trained models to new contexts requiring smaller labeled sets. However, testing fine-tuned models under constrained labeling budgets remains a critical challenge. This paper introduces MetaSel, a new approach, tailored for fine-tuned DNN models, to select tests from unlabeled inputs. MetaSel assumes that fine-tuned and pre-trained models share related data distributions and exhibit similar behaviors for many inputs. However, their behaviors diverge within the input subspace where fine-tuning alters decision boundaries, making those inputs more prone to misclassification. Unlike general approaches that rely solely on the DNN model and its input set, MetaSel leverages information from both the fine-tuned and pre-trained models and their behavioral differences to estimate misclassification probability for unlabeled test inputs, enabling more effective test selection. Our extensive empirical evaluation, comparing MetaSel against 11 state-of-the-art approaches and involving 68 fine-tuned models across weak, medium, and strong distribution shifts, demonstrates that MetaSel consistently delivers significant improvements in Test Relative Coverage (TRC) over existing baselines, particularly under highly constrained labeling budgets. MetaSel shows average TRC improvements of 28.46% to 56.18% over the most frequent second-best baselines while maintaining a high TRC median and low variability. Our results confirm MetaSel's practicality, robustness, and cost-effectiveness for test selection in the context of fine-tuned models."

To address this issue, researchers have sought to apply network pruning techniques to LLMs. A critical challenge in pruning is allocation the sparsity for each layer. Recent sparsity allocation methods is often based on heuristics or search that can easily lead to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we conducted an extensive investigation into various LLMs and revealed three significant discoveries: (1) the layerwise pruning sensitivity (LPS) of LLMs is highly non-uniform, (2) the choice of pruning metric affects LPS, and (3) the performance of a sparse model is related to the uniformity of its layerwise redundancy level. Based on these observations, we propose that the layerwise sparsity of LLMs should adhere to three principles: \\emph{non-uniformity}, \\emph{pruning metric dependency}, and \\emph{uniform layerwise redundancy level} in the pruned model. To this end, we proposed Maximum Redundancy Pruning (MRP), an iterative pruning algorithm that prunes in the most redundant layers (\\emph{i.e.}, those with the highest non-outlier ratio) at each iteration. The achieved layerwise sparsity aligns with the outlined principles. We conducted extensive experiments on publicly available LLMs, including the LLaMA2 and OPT, across various benchmarks.

In contrast, the traditional cut flow method offers simplicity and interpretability but requires extensive manual tuning to identify optimal cut boundaries. To merge the strengths of both approaches, we propose the Learnable Cut Flow (LCF), a neural network that transforms the traditional cut selection into a fully differentiable, data-driven process. LCF implements two cut strategies-parallel, where observable distributions are treated independently, and sequential, where prior cuts shape subsequent ones-to flexibly determine optimal boundaries. Building on this strategy, we introduce the Learnable Importance, a metric that quantifies feature importance and adjusts their contributions to the loss accordingly, offering model-driven insights unlike ad-hoc metrics. To ensure differentiability, a modified loss function replaces hard cuts with mask operations, preserving data shape throughout the training process. LCF is tested on six varied mock datasets and a realistic diboson vs. QCD dataset. Results demonstrate that LCF 1. accurately learns cut boundaries across typical feature distributions in both parallel and sequential strategies, 2. assigns higher importance to discriminative features with minimal overlap, 3. handles redundant or correlated features robustly, and 4. performs effectively in real-world scenarios. In the diboson dataset, LCF initially underperforms boosted decision trees and multiplayer perceptrons when using all observables. However, pruning less critical features-guided by learned importance-boosts its performance to match or exceed these baselines. LCF bridges the gap between traditional cut flow method and modern black-box neural networks, delivering actionable insights into the training process and feature importance."

Unlike those attempts focusing on single auctions, we develop deep learning methods for double auctions, where imperfect information exists on both the demand and supply sides. The previous attempts on single auction cannot directly apply to our contexts and those attempts additionally suffer from limited generalizability, inefficiency in ensuring the constraints, and learning fluctuations. We innovate in designing deep learning models for solving the more complex problem and additionally addressing the previous models' three limitations. Specifically, we achieve generalizability by leveraging a transformer-based architecture to model market participants as sequences for varying market sizes; we utilize the numerical features of the constraints and pre-treat them for a higher learning efficiency; we develop a gradient-conflict-elimination scheme to address the problem of learning fluctuation.

When rapid model deployment is critical, such as in classifying emerging social media trends or combating new forms of online abuse tied to current events, the ability to generate training data is invaluable. While prior research has examined the comparability of synthetic data to human-labeled data, this study introduces a novel sampling algorithm, based on the maximum coverage problem, to select a representative subset from a synthetically generated dataset. Our results demonstrate that training a classifier on this contextually sampled subset achieves superior performance compared to training on the entire dataset.

However, this seemingly promising approach faces a significant and long-ignored challenge. ZO requires generating a substantial number of Gaussian random numbers, which poses significant difficulties and even makes it infeasible for hardware platforms, such as FPGAs and ASICs. In this paper, we identify this critical issue, which arises from the mismatch between algorithm and hardware designers. To address this issue, we proposed PeZO, a perturbation-efficient ZO framework. Specifically, we design random number reuse strategies to significantly reduce the demand for random number generation and introduce a hardware-friendly adaptive scaling method to replace the costly Gaussian distribution with a uniform distribution. Our experiments show that PeZO reduces the required LUTs and FFs for random number generation by 48.6\\% and 12.7\\%, and saves at maximum 86\\% power consumption, all without compromising training performance, making ZO optimization feasible for on-device training. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore the potential of on-device ZO optimization, providing valuable insights for future research."

However, these methods are limited, as augmentation is only effective when the synthetic distribution approximates that of unseen domains, thus failing to ensure generalization across diverse scenarios.\n  While DEtection TRansformer (DETR) has shown strong generalization in domain adaptation due to global context modeling, its potential for SDG remains underexplored. To this end, we propose Style-Adaptive DEtection TRansformer (SA-DETR), a DETR-based detector tailored for SDG. SA-DETR introduces an online domain style adapter that projects the style representation of unseen domains into the source domain via a dynamic memory bank. This bank self-organizes into diverse style prototypes and is continuously updated under a test-time adaptation framework, enabling effective style rectification.\n  Additionally, we design an object-aware contrastive learning module to promote extraction of domain-invariant features. By applying gating masks that constrain contrastive learning in both spatial and semantic dimensions, this module facilitates instance-level cross-domain contrast and enhances generalization.\n  Extensive experiments across five distinct weather scenarios demonstrate that SA-DETR consistently outperforms existing methods in both detection accuracy and domain generalization capability."

However, existing methods either focus on model generalization or concentrate on robustness. The unified mechanism, to simultaneously address the challenges of generalization and robustness, is less explored. In this paper, we argue that robustness can be view as a specific form of domain shift, and empirically reveal an intrinsic mechanism for model generalization of AIGT detection task.

Specifically, the task is significantly challenged by the object motion, where existing models are limited to predict only partial attributes of the dynamic scenes, such as depth or pointmaps spanning only over a pair of frames. Since these attributes are inherently noisy under multiple frames, test-time global optimizations are often employed to fully recover the geometry, which is liable to failure and incurs heavy inference costs. To address the challenge, we present a new model, coined MMP, to estimate the geometry in a feed-forward manner, which produces a dynamic pointmap representation that evolves over multiple frames. Specifically, based on the recent Siamese architecture, we introduce a new trajectory encoding module to project point-wise dynamics on the representation for each frame, which can provide significantly improved expressiveness for dynamic scenes. In our experiments, we find MMP can achieve state-of-the-art quality in feed-forward pointmap prediction, e.g., 15.1% enhancement in the regression error."

In this work, we introduce ViCTr (Vital Consistency Transfer), a novel two-stage framework that combines a rectified flow trajectory with a Tweedie-corrected diffusion process to achieve high-fidelity, pathology-aware image synthesis. First, we pretrain ViCTr on the ATLAS-8k dataset using Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) to preserve critical anatomical structures. We then fine-tune the model adversarially with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules for precise control over pathology severity. By reformulating Tweedie's formula within a linear trajectory framework, ViCTr supports one-step sampling, reducing inference from 50 steps to just 4, without sacrificing anatomical realism. We evaluate ViCTr on BTCV (CT), AMOS (MRI), and CirrMRI600+ (cirrhosis) datasets. Results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving a Medical Frechet Inception Distance (MFID) of 17.01 for cirrhosis synthesis 28% lower than existing approaches and improving nnUNet segmentation by +3.8% mDSC when used for data augmentation.

Recent research suggests that models may be particularly sensitive to certain semantics in visual inputs (such as ``wet,'' ``foggy''), making them prone to errors. Inspired by this, in this paper we conducted the first exploration on large vision-language models (LVLMs) and found that LVLMs indeed are susceptible to hallucinations and various errors when facing specific semantic concepts in images. To efficiently search for these sensitive concepts, we integrated large language models (LLMs) and text-to-image (T2I) models to propose a novel semantic evolution framework. Randomly initialized semantic concepts undergo LLM-based crossover and mutation operations to form image descriptions, which are then converted by T2I models into visual inputs for LVLMs. The task-specific performance of LVLMs on each input is quantified as fitness scores for the involved semantics and serves as reward signals to further guide LLMs in exploring concepts that induce LVLMs. Extensive experiments on seven mainstream LVLMs and two multimodal tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Additionally, we provide interesting findings about the sensitive semantics of LVLMs, aiming to inspire further in-depth research."

However, the reasoning paths generated by teacher models often reflect only surface-level traces of their underlying authentic reasoning. Insights from cognitive neuroscience suggest that authentic reasoning involves a complex interweaving between meta-reasoning (which selects appropriate sub-problems from multiple candidates) and solving (which addresses the sub-problem). This implies authentic reasoning has an implicit multi-branch structure. Supervised fine-tuning collapses this rich structure into a flat sequence of token prediction in the teacher's reasoning path, preventing effective distillation of this structure to students. To address this limitation, we propose RLKD, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based distillation framework guided by a novel Generative Structure Reward Model (GSRM). Our GSRM converts reasoning paths into multiple meta-reasoning-solving steps and computes rewards to measure structural alignment between student and teacher reasoning. RLKD combines this reward with RL, enabling student LLMs to internalize the teacher's implicit multi-branch reasoning structure rather than merely mimicking fixed output paths. Experiments show RLKD surpasses standard SFT-RL pipelines even when trained on 0.1% of data under an RL-only regime, unlocking greater student reasoning potential than SFT-based distillation."

To address these limitations, we propose \\Ours{}, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based multi-agent collaborative framework that models medical consultations as a dynamic decision-making process under uncertainty. The doctor agent continuously optimizes its questioning strategy within the RL framework through multi-turn interactions with the patient agent, dynamically adjusting its information-gathering path based on comprehensive rewards from the Consultation Evaluator.

Notably, we constructed MTMedDialog, the first English multi-turn medical consultation dataset capable of simulating patient interactions. Experiments demonstrate that \\Ours{} outperforms existing models in both multi-turn reasoning capability and final diagnostic performance.

We fine-tune Whisper models on the Speak & Improve 2025 corpus using low-rank adaptation (LoRA), without recourse to external audio training data. We compare three annotation schemes: removing hesitations (Pure), generic tags (Rich), and acoustically precise fillers inferred by Gemini 2.0 Flash from existing audio-transcript pairs (Extra). Our challenge system achieved 6.47% WER (Pure) and 5.81% WER (Extra). Post-challenge experiments reveal that fine-tuning Whisper Large V3 Turbo with the \"Extra\" scheme yielded a 5.5% WER, an 11.3% relative improvement over the \"Pure\" scheme (6.2% WER).

In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play module called Learnable Separable Kernels (LSKs), which are formally rank-one matrices designed to directly enhance image frequency components. We begin by explaining why LSKs are particularly suitable for SISR tasks from a frequency perspective. Baseline methods incorporating LSKs demonstrate a significant reduction of over 60\\% in both the number of parameters and computational requirements. This reduction is achieved through the decomposition of LSKs into orthogonal and mergeable one-dimensional kernels. Additionally, we perform an interpretable analysis of the feature maps generated by LSKs. Visualization results reveal the capability of LSKs to enhance image frequency components effectively. Extensive experiments show that incorporating LSKs not only reduces the number of parameters and computational load but also improves overall model performance. Moreover, these experiments demonstrate that models utilizing LSKs exhibit superior performance, particularly as the upscaling factor increases."

Range-view-based methods have gained popularity due to their high computational efficiency and compatibility with real-time deployment. However, their generalized performance under adverse weather conditions remains underexplored, limiting their reliability in real-world environments. In this work, we identify and analyze the unique challenges that affect the generalization of range-view LiDAR segmentation in severe weather. To address these challenges, we propose a modular and lightweight framework that enhances robustness without altering the core architecture of existing models. Our method reformulates the initial stem block of standard range-view networks into two branches to process geometric attributes and reflectance intensity separately. Specifically, a Geometric Abnormality Suppression (GAS) module reduces the influence of weather-induced spatial noise, and a Reflectance Distortion Calibration (RDC) module corrects reflectance distortions through memory-guided adaptive instance normalization. The processed features are then fused and passed to the original segmentation pipeline. Extensive experiments on different benchmarks and baseline models demonstrate that our approach significantly improves generalization to adverse weather with minimal inference overhead, offering a practical and effective solution for real-world LiDAR segmentation."

This work examines the sensitivity of widely used reference-based metrics in relation to the choice of reference sets, analyzing three diverse multi-reference summarization datasets: SummEval, GUMSum, and DUC2004. We demonstrate that many popular metrics exhibit significant instability. This instability is particularly concerning for n-gram-based metrics like ROUGE, where model rankings vary depending on the reference sets, undermining the reliability of model comparisons. We also collect human judgments on LLM outputs for genre-diverse data and examine their correlation with metrics to supplement existing findings beyond newswire summaries, finding weak-to-no correlation. Taken together, we recommend incorporating reference set variation into summarization evaluation to enhance consistency alongside correlation with human judgments, especially when evaluating LLMs."

However, the assumption of unconfoundedness may not hold for a fixed outcome in practice. To address this foundational limitation, we directly optimize the outcome definition to maximize causal identifiability. Our DEBIAS (Durable Effects with Backdoor-Invariant Aggregated Symptoms) algorithm learns non-negative, clinically interpretable weights for outcome aggregation, maximizing durable treatment effects and empirically minimizing both observed and latent confounding by leveraging the time-limited direct effects of prior treatments in psychiatric longitudinal data. The algorithm also furnishes an empirically verifiable test for outcome unconfoundedness. DEBIAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recovering causal effects for clinically interpretable composite outcomes across comprehensive experiments in depression and schizophrenia."

This work introduces a novel approach that extends beyond classification, enabling interpretable risk modelling through a Conditional Variational Autoencoder. The proposed method learns a structured latent space that captures semantic relationships among lesions, allowing for a nuanced, continuous assessment of morphological differences. An SVM is also trained on this representation effectively differentiating between benign nevi and melanomas, demonstrating strong and consistent performance. More importantly, the learned latent space supports visual and geometric interpretation of malignancy, with the spatial proximity of a lesion to known melanomas serving as a meaningful indicator of risk. This approach bridges predictive performance with clinical applicability, fostering early detection, highlighting ambiguous cases, and enhancing trust in AI-assisted diagnosis through transparent and interpretable decision-making."

We present TESSERA, an open, global, land-oriented remote sensing foundation model that uses self-supervised learning to generate `ready-to-use' embeddings at 10~m scale from pixel-level satellite time series data. TESSERA uses two parallel Transformer-based encoders to combine optical data from ten Sentinel-2 spectral bands at 10-60~m spatial resolution and two Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar backscatter coefficients at 10~m resolution to create embeddings that are subsequently fused with a multilayer perceptron to create annual global embedding maps.

To address them, we introduce CLIP-Guided backdoor Defense (CGD), an efficient and effective method that mitigates various backdoor attacks. CGD utilizes a publicly accessible CLIP model to identify inputs that are likely to be clean or poisoned. It then retrains the model with these inputs, using CLIP's logits as a guidance to effectively neutralize the backdoor. Experiments on 4 datasets and 11 attack types demonstrate that CGD reduces attack success rates (ASRs) to below 1% while maintaining clean accuracy (CA) with a maximum drop of only 0.3%, outperforming existing defenses. Additionally, we show that clean-data-based defenses can be adapted to poisoned data using CGD. Also, CGD exhibits strong robustness, maintaining low ASRs even when employing a weaker CLIP model or when CLIP itself is compromised by a backdoor.

Through a novel 3D feature distillation approach, we obtain unsupervised 3D semantics. In both 3D and 2D unsupervised scene understanding, SceneDINO reaches state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy. Linear probing our 3D features matches the segmentation accuracy of a current supervised SSC approach. Additionally, we showcase the domain generalization and multi-view consistency of SceneDINO, taking the first steps towards a strong foundation for single image 3D scene understanding."

We present a comparative analysis of RL and SFT on the same maths problems with the same model and similar hyperparameters. We find that RL yields minor in-domain gains on maths and slight degradation on knowledge-intensive benchmarks like MMLU, while both trends are more pronounced in SFT. We also analyse model parameters across checkpoints, observing that both algorithms modify query and key weights the most. Meanwhile, SFT exhibits greater updates and also affects mid-layer MLPs more, leading us to hypothesise that this may have caused the out-of-domain degradation. We therefore investigate whether freezing parts of the model during training can mitigate the reduced performance on knowledge-intensive benchmarks. However, our results are inconclusive, with benefits on GPQA:Diamond and degradation on other benchmarks. Taken together, our observations provide a preliminary indication for why RL amplifies existing capabilities, while SFT replaces old skills with new ones."

These methods exhibited excellent generalization capabilities in instruction understanding and task reasoning. However, they were constrained by the fixed knowledge bases and reasoning abilities of LLMs, preventing fully incorporating experiential knowledge and thus resulting in a lack of efficient evolutionary capacity. To address this, we drew inspiration from the evolution capabilities of natural agents, and proposed a self-evolving VLN framework (SE-VLN) to endow VLN agents with the ability to continuously evolve during testing. To the best of our knowledge, it was the first time that an multimodal LLM-powered self-evolving VLN framework was proposed. Specifically, SE-VLN comprised three core modules, i.e., a hierarchical memory module to transfer successful and failure cases into reusable knowledge, a retrieval-augmented thought-based reasoning module to retrieve experience and enable multi-step decision-making, and a reflection module to realize continual evolution. Comprehensive tests illustrated that the SE-VLN achieved navigation success rates of 57% and 35.2% in unseen environments, representing absolute performance improvements of 23.9% and 15.0% over current state-of-the-art methods on R2R and REVERSE datasets, respectively.

Conceived as a simple heuristic quantifying the extent to which a given term's occurrences are concentrated in any one given document out of many, TF-IDF and its many variants are routinely used as term-weighting schemes in diverse text analysis applications. There is a growing body of scholarship dedicated to placing TF-IDF on a sound theoretical foundation. Building on that tradition, this paper justifies the use of TF-IDF to the statistics community by demonstrating how the famed expression can be understood from a significance testing perspective. We show that the common TF-IDF variant TF-ICF is, under mild regularity conditions, closely related to the negative logarithm of the $p$-value from a one-tailed version of Fisher's exact test of statistical significance. As a corollary, we establish a connection between TF-IDF and the said negative log-transformed $p$-value under certain idealized assumptions. We further demonstrate, as a limiting case, that this same quantity converges to TF-IDF in the limit of an infinitely large document collection. The Fisher's exact test justification of TF-IDF equips the working statistician with a ready explanation of the term-weighting scheme's long-established effectiveness."

The study of the NTK dynamics has led to several critical discoveries in recent years, in generalization and scaling behaviours. However, this body of work has been limited to the single task setting, where the data distribution is assumed constant over time. In this work, we present a comprehensive empirical analysis of NTK dynamics in continual learning, where the data distribution shifts over time.

In fact, the prevalent large proprietary models could hardly generate verifiable programs. A promising yet largely uncharted alternative is formal language-based reasoning. Grounding LLMs in rigorous formal systems where generative models operate in formal language spaces (e.g., Dafny) enables the automatic and mathematically provable verification of their reasoning processes and outcomes. This capability is pivotal for achieving large-scale, reliable formal software verification. It is a common practice to employ human-annotated chain-of-thought and other human priors to induce the reasoning and coding capabilities of LLMs. Unfortunately, it becomes unacceptably all-consuming to provide such priors for supervising complex programming tasks. In this work, we systematically explore ways to reduce human priors with the formal language, Dafny, as the main environment for our pilot study. Our pipeline mainly relies on introducing an automatic and scalable data curation pipeline, and careful RL designs integrated with feedback from the formal language verifier. We introduce DafnyComp, a benchmark of compositional formal programs with auto-formalized specifications for specification reasoning. Our supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage enables even small models (e.g., 0.5B) to generate syntactically valid and verifiable Dafny code, surpassing proprietary models. RL with regularization further improves performance, achieving stronger generalization to out-of-domain tasks and outperforming all strong baselines on the challenging DafnyComp benchmark."

While effective, CoT introduces substantial computational overhead due to its reliance on autoregressive decoding over long token sequences. Existing acceleration strategies either reduce sequence length through early stopping or compressive reward designs, or improve decoding speed via speculative decoding with smaller models. However, speculative decoding suffers from limited speedup when the agreement between small and large models is low, and fails to exploit the potential advantages of small models in producing concise intermediate reasoning. In this paper, we present R-Stitch, a token-level, confidence-based hybrid decoding framework that accelerates CoT inference by switching between a small language model (SLM) and a large language model (LLM) along the reasoning trajectory. R-Stitch uses the SLM to generate tokens by default and delegates to the LLM only when the SLM's confidence falls below a threshold. This design avoids full-sequence rollback and selectively invokes the LLM on uncertain steps, preserving both efficiency and answer quality. R-Stitch is model-agnostic, training-free, and compatible with standard decoding pipelines. Experiments on math reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that R-Stitch achieves up to 85\\% reduction in inference latency with negligible accuracy drop, highlighting its practical effectiveness in accelerating CoT reasoning."

Despite this advantage, the existing method can only measure the proximity without yielding the distance as an explicit function of rigid body transformation. Thus, an optimizable distance function on the manifold has remained underdeveloped, stifling its application in registration problems. This paper is the first to explicitly derive an optimizable cost function between two Grassmannian features with respect to rigid body transformation ($\\mathbf{R}$ and $\\mathbf{t}$). Specifically, we present a rigorous mathematical proof demonstrating that the bases of high-dimensional linear subspaces can serve as an explicit representation of the cost. Finally, we propose an optimizable cost function based on the transformed bases that can be applied to the registration problem of any affine subspace. Compared to vector parameter-based approaches, our method is able to find a globally optimal solution by directly minimizing the geodesic distance which is agnostic to representation ambiguity. The resulting cost function and its extension to the inlier-set maximizing Branch-and-Bound (BnB) solver have been demonstrated to improve the convergence of existing solutions or outperform them in various computer vision tasks.

In this submission, we propose a sequence-to-sequence Transformer that autoregressively predicts fMRI activity from visual, auditory, and language inputs. Stimulus features were extracted using pretrained models including VideoMAE, HuBERT, Qwen, and BridgeTower. The decoder integrates information from prior brain states and current stimuli via dual cross-attention mechanisms that attend to both perceptual information extracted from the stimulus as well as narrative information provided by high-level summaries of the content. One core innovation of our approach is the use of sequences of multimodal context to predict sequences of brain activity, enabling the model to capture long-range temporal structure in both stimuli and neural responses. Another is the combination of a shared encoder with partial subject-specific decoder, which leverages common representational structure across subjects while accounting for individual variability. Our model achieves strong performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data, demonstrating the effectiveness of temporally-aware, multimodal sequence modeling for brain activity prediction.

However, most existing models treat speech merely as a vehicle for linguistic content, often overlooking the rich paralinguistic and speaker characteristic cues embedded in human speech, such as dialect, age, emotion, and non-speech vocalizations. In this work, we introduce GOAT-SLM, a novel spoken language model with paralinguistic and speaker characteristic awareness, designed to extend spoken language modeling beyond text semantics. GOAT-SLM adopts a dual-modality head architecture that decouples linguistic modeling from acoustic realization, enabling robust language understanding while supporting expressive and adaptive speech generation. To enhance model efficiency and versatility, we propose a modular, staged training strategy that progressively aligns linguistic, paralinguistic, and speaker characteristic information using large-scale speech-text corpora. Experimental results on TELEVAL, a multi-dimensional evaluation benchmark, demonstrate that GOAT-SLM achieves well-balanced performance across both semantic and non-semantic tasks, and outperforms existing open-source models in handling emotion, dialectal variation, and age-sensitive interactions. This work highlights the importance of modeling beyond linguistic content and advances the development of more natural, adaptive, and socially aware spoken language systems."

However, integrating LLMs into clinical practice raises concerns about accuracy, potential harm, and clinician acceptance. Despite their promise, AI applications in HIV care remain underexplored, and LLM benchmarking studies are scarce. This study evaluates the current capabilities of LLMs in HIV management, highlighting their strengths and limitations. We introduce HIVMedQA, a benchmark designed to assess open-ended medical question answering in HIV care. The dataset consists of curated, clinically relevant questions developed with input from an infectious disease physician. We evaluated seven general-purpose and three medically specialized LLMs, applying prompt engineering to enhance performance. Our evaluation framework incorporates both lexical similarity and an LLM-as-a-judge approach, extended to better reflect clinical relevance. We assessed performance across key dimensions: question comprehension, reasoning, knowledge recall, bias, potential harm, and factual accuracy. Results show that Gemini 2.5 Pro consistently outperformed other models across most dimensions. Notably, two of the top three models were proprietary. Performance declined as question complexity increased. Medically fine-tuned models did not always outperform general-purpose ones, and larger model size was not a reliable predictor of performance. Reasoning and comprehension were more challenging than factual recall, and cognitive biases such as recency and status quo were observed. These findings underscore the need for targeted development and evaluation to ensure safe, effective LLM integration in clinical care."

This assumption often violates the nature of real-world graphs, where labels frequently contain noise. Given this gap, this paper systematically investigates robust node classification for class-imbalanced graphs with noisy labels. We propose GraphALP, a novel Graph Augmentation framework based on Large language models (LLMs) and Pseudo-labeling techniques. Specifically, we design an LLM-based oversampling method to generate synthetic minority nodes, producing label-accurate minority nodes to alleviate class imbalance. Based on the class-balanced graphs, we develop a dynamically weighted pseudo-labeling method to obtain high-confidence pseudo labels to reduce label noise ratio. Additionally, we implement a secondary LLM-guided oversampling mechanism to mitigate potential class distribution skew caused by pseudo labels. Experimental results show that GraphALP achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on class-imbalanced graphs with noisy labels."

To address this, we introduce TeEFusion (Text Embeddings Fusion), a novel and efficient distillation method that directly incorporates the guidance magnitude into the text embeddings and distills the teacher model's complex sampling strategy. By simply fusing conditional and unconditional text embeddings using linear operations, TeEFusion reconstructs the desired guidance without adding extra parameters, simultaneously enabling the student model to learn from the teacher's output produced via its sophisticated sampling approach. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art models such as SD3 demonstrate that our method allows the student to closely mimic the teacher's performance with a far simpler and more efficient sampling strategy. Consequently, the student model achieves inference speeds up to 6$\\times$ faster than the teacher model, while maintaining image quality at levels comparable to those obtained through the teacher's complex sampling approach.

These ice clouds can alter Earth's radiative balance, potentially rivaling the warming effect of aviation CO2. Physics-based models provide useful estimates of contrail formation and climate impact, but their accuracy depends heavily on the quality of atmospheric input data and on assumptions used to represent complex processes like ice particle formation and humidity-driven persistence. Observational data from remote sensors, such as satellites and ground cameras, could be used to validate and calibrate these models. However, existing datasets don't explore all aspect of contrail dynamics and formation: they typically lack temporal tracking, and do not attribute contrails to their source flights. To address these limitations, we present the Ground Visible Camera Contrail Sequences (GVCCS), a new open data set of contrails recorded with a ground-based all-sky camera in the visible range. Each contrail is individually labeled and tracked over time, allowing a detailed analysis of its lifecycle. The dataset contains 122 video sequences (24,228 frames) and includes flight identifiers for contrails that form above the camera. As reference, we also propose a unified deep learning framework for contrail analysis using a panoptic segmentation model that performs semantic segmentation (contrail pixel identification), instance segmentation (individual contrail separation), and temporal tracking in a single architecture. By providing high-quality, temporally resolved annotations and a benchmark for model evaluation, our work supports improved contrail monitoring and will facilitate better calibration of physical models. This sets the groundwork for more accurate climate impact understanding and assessments."

We address this important problem from a computational and machine learning perspective. More specifically, we want to statistically estimate all the relevant parameters for the new coronavirus COVID-19, such as the reproduction number, fatality rate or length of infectiousness period, based on Romanian patients, as well as be able to predict future outcomes. This endeavor is important, since it is well known that these factors vary across the globe, and might be dependent on many causes, including social, medical, age and genetic factors. We use a recently published improved version of SEIR, which is the classic, established model for infectious diseases. We want to infer all the parameters of the model, which govern the evolution of the pandemic in Romania, based on the only reliable, true measurement, which is the number of deaths. Once the model parameters are estimated, we are able to predict all the other relevant measures, such as the number of exposed and infectious people. To this end, we propose a self-supervised approach to train a deep convolutional network to guess the correct set of Modified-SEIR model parameters, given the observed number of daily fatalities. Then, we refine the solution with a stochastic coordinate descent approach. We compare our deep learning optimization scheme with the classic grid search approach and show great improvement in both computational time and prediction accuracy. We find an optimistic result in the case fatality rate for Romania which may be around 0.3% and we also demonstrate that our model is able to correctly predict the number of daily fatalities for up to three weeks in the future."

This barycenter is defined as the unique probability measure that minimizes the sum of entropic optimal transport (EOT) costs with respect to a family of given probability measures, plus an entropy term. We denote it $(\\lambda,\\tau)$-barycenter, where $\\lambda$ is the inner regularization strength and $\\tau$ the outer one. This formulation recovers several previously proposed EOT barycenters for various choices of $\\lambda,\\tau \\geq 0$ and generalizes them. First, in spite of -- and in fact owing to -- being \\emph{doubly} regularized, we show that our formulation is debiased for $\\tau=\\lambda/2$: the suboptimality in the (unregularized) Wasserstein barycenter objective is, for smooth densities, of the order of the strength $\\lambda^2$ of entropic regularization, instead of $\\max\\{\\lambda,\\tau\\}$ in general. We discuss this phenomenon for isotropic Gaussians where all $(\\lambda,\\tau)$-barycenters have closed form. Second, we show that for $\\lambda,\\tau>0$, this barycenter has a smooth density and is strongly stable under perturbation of the marginals. In particular, it can be estimated efficiently: given $n$ samples from each of the probability measures, it converges in relative entropy to the population barycenter at a rate $n^{-1/2}$. And finally, this formulation lends itself naturally to a grid-free optimization algorithm: we propose a simple \\emph{noisy particle gradient descent} which, in the mean-field limit, converges globally at an exponential rate to the barycenter."

Several zero-shot ranking methods based on LLMs have recently been proposed. Among many aspects, methods differ across (1) the ranking algorithm they implement, e.g., pointwise vs. listwise, (2) the backbone LLMs used, e.g., GPT3.5 vs. FLAN-T5, (3) the components and wording used in prompts, e.g., the use or not of role-definition (role-playing) and the actual words used to express this. It is currently unclear whether performance differences are due to the underlying ranking algorithm, or because of spurious factors such as better choice of words used in prompts. This confusion risks to undermine future research. Through our large-scale experimentation and analysis, we find that ranking algorithms do contribute to differences between methods for zero-shot LLM ranking. However, so do the LLM backbones -- but even more importantly, the choice of prompt components and wordings affect the ranking. In fact, in our experiments, we find that, at times, these latter elements have more impact on the ranker's effectiveness than the actual ranking algorithms, and that differences among ranking methods become more blurred when prompt variations are considered."

This study introduces a novel data assimilation approach that integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with optimisation techniques to enhance the accuracy of mean flow reconstruction, using Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations as a baseline. The method leverages the adjoint approach, incorporating RANS-derived gradients as optimisation terms during GNN training, ensuring that the learned model adheres to physical laws and maintains consistency. Additionally, the GNN framework is well-suited for handling unstructured data, which is common in the complex geometries encountered in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The GNN is interfaced with the Finite Element Method (FEM) for numerical simulations, enabling accurate modelling in unstructured domains. We consider the reconstruction of mean flow past bluff bodies at low Reynolds numbers as a test case, addressing tasks such as sparse data recovery, denoising, and inpainting of missing flow data. The key strengths of the approach lie in its integration of physical constraints into the GNN training process, leading to accurate predictions with limited data, making it particularly valuable when data are scarce or corrupted. Results demonstrate significant improvements in the accuracy of mean flow reconstructions, even with limited training data, compared to analogous purely data-driven models."

SSPS samples positives close to their anchor in the representation space, assuming that these pseudo-positives belong to the same speaker identity but correspond to different recording conditions. This method consistently demonstrates improvements in SV performance on VoxCeleb benchmarks when applied to major SSL frameworks, including SimCLR, SwAV, VICReg, and DINO. Using SSPS, SimCLR and DINO achieve 2.57% and 2.53% EER on VoxCeleb1-O, respectively. SimCLR yields a 58% relative reduction in EER, getting comparable performance to DINO with a simpler training framework. Furthermore, SSPS lowers intra-class variance and reduces channel information in speaker representations while exhibiting greater robustness without data-augmentation."

To investigate mechanisms underlying such generalization, we introduce SimplifiedRPM, a novel benchmark for systematically evaluating abstract relational reasoning, addressing limitations in prior datasets. In parallel, we conduct human experiments to quantify relational difficulty, enabling direct model-human comparisons. Testing four models, ResNet-50, Vision Transformer, Wild Relation Network, and Scattering Compositional Learner (SCL), we find that SCL generalizes best and most closely aligns with human behavior. Using a geometric approach, we identify key representation properties that accurately predict generalization and uncover a fundamental trade-off between signal and dimensionality: novel relations compress into training-induced subspaces. Layer-wise analysis reveals where relational structure emerges, highlights bottlenecks, and generates concrete hypotheses about abstract reasoning in the brain. Motivated by these insights, we propose SNRloss, a novel objective explicitly balancing representation geometry. Our results establish a geometric foundation for relational reasoning, paving the way for more human-like visual reasoning in AI and opening promising avenues for extending geometric analysis to broader cognitive tasks."

However, standard methods such as finite difference or finite element are computationally expensive. Recent studies have shown that a new class of machine learning models, called neural operators, can solve the elastodynamic wave equation orders of magnitude faster than conventional methods. Full waveform inversion is a prime beneficiary of the accelerated simulations. Neural operators, as end-to-end differentiable operators, combined with automatic differentiation, provide an alternative approach to the adjoint-state method. State-of-the-art optimization techniques built into PyTorch provide neural operators with greater flexibility to improve the optimization dynamics of full waveform inversion, thereby mitigating cycle-skipping problems. In this study, we demonstrate the first application of neural operators for full waveform inversion on a real seismic dataset, which consists of several nodal transects collected across the San Gabriel, Chino, and San Bernardino basins in the Los Angeles metropolitan area."

Previous works on controllable motion generation often rely on a predefined set of dense spatio-temporal specifications (e.g., dense pelvis trajectories with exact per-frame timing), limiting practicality for animators. To process high-level intent and intuitive control in diverse scenarios, we propose a practical controllable motions synthesis framework that respects sparse and flexible keyjoint signals. Our approach employs a decomposed diffusion-based motion synthesis framework that first synthesizes keyjoint movements from sparse input control signals and then synthesizes full-body motion based on the completed keyjoint trajectories. The low-dimensional keyjoint movements can easily adapt to various control signal types, such as end-effector position for diverse goal-driven motion synthesis, or incorporate functional constraints on a subset of keyjoints. Additionally, we introduce a time-agnostic control formulation, eliminating the need for frame-specific timing annotations and enhancing control flexibility. Then, the shared second stage can synthesize a natural whole-body motion that precisely satisfies the task requirement from dense keyjoint movements. We demonstrate the effectiveness of sparse and flexible keyjoint control through comprehensive experiments on diverse datasets and scenarios."

Representing patient anatomy and associated motion fields as 3D Gaussians, we developed a Gaussian representation-based framework (PMF-STGR) for fast and accurate dynamic CBCT reconstruction. PMF-STGR comprises three major components: a dense set of 3D Gaussians to reconstruct a reference-frame CBCT for the dynamic sequence; another 3D Gaussian set to capture three-level, coarse-to-fine motion-basis-components (MBCs) to model the intra-scan motion; and a CNN-based motion encoder to solve projection-specific temporal coefficients for the MBCs. Scaled by the temporal coefficients, the learned MBCs will combine into deformation vector fields to deform the reference CBCT into projection-specific, time-resolved CBCTs to capture the dynamic motion. Due to the strong representation power of 3D Gaussians, PMF-STGR can reconstruct dynamic CBCTs in a 'one-shot' training fashion from a standard 3D CBCT scan, without using any prior anatomical or motion model. We evaluated PMF-STGR using XCAT phantom simulations and real patient scans. Metrics including the image relative error, structural-similarity-index-measure, tumor center-of-mass-error, and landmark localization error were used to evaluate the accuracy of solved dynamic CBCTs and motion. PMF-STGR shows clear advantages over a state-of-the-art, INR-based approach, PMF-STINR. Compared with PMF-STINR, PMF-STGR reduces reconstruction time by 50% while reconstructing less blurred images with better motion accuracy. With improved efficiency and accuracy, PMF-STGR enhances the applicability of dynamic CBCT imaging for potential clinical translation."

However, to make such an agent viable for real-world deployment and accessible at scale, significant optimizations are required to ensure high efficiency and low cost. This position paper presents a design of the Super Agent System powered by the hybrid AI routers. Upon receiving a user prompt, the system first detects the intent of the user, then routes the request to specialized task agents with the necessary tools or automatically generates agentic workflows. In practice, most applications directly serve as AI assistants on edge devices such as phones and robots. As different language models vary in capability and cloud-based models often entail high computational costs, latency, and privacy concerns, we then explore the hybrid mode where the router dynamically selects between local and cloud models based on task complexity. Finally, we introduce the blueprint of an on-device super agent enhanced with cloud. With advances in multi-modality models and edge hardware, we envision that most computations can be handled locally, with cloud collaboration only as needed.

Unlike traditional approaches that treat model specification as a static optimisation problem, Delphos represents a paradigm shift: it frames this specification challenge as a sequential decision-making problem, formalised as a Markov Decision Process. In this setting, an agent learns to specify well-performing model candidates by choosing a sequence of modelling actions - such as selecting variables, accommodating both generic and alternative-specific taste parameters, applying non-linear transformations, and including interactions with covariates - and interacting with a modelling environment that estimates each candidate and returns a reward signal. Specifically, Delphos uses a Deep Q-Network that receives delayed rewards based on modelling outcomes (e.g., log-likelihood) and behavioural expectations (e.g., parameter signs), and distributes rewards across the sequence of actions to learn which modelling decisions lead to well-performing candidates. We evaluate Delphos on both simulated and empirical datasets, varying the size of the modelling space and the reward function. To assess the agent's performance in navigating the model space, we analyse the learning curve, the distribution of Q-values, occupancy metrics, and Pareto fronts. Our results show that the agent learns to adaptively explore strategies to identify well-performing models across search spaces, even without prior domain knowledge. It efficiently explores large modelling spaces, concentrates its search in high-reward regions, and suggests candidates that define Pareto frontiers balancing model fit and behavioural plausibility. These findings highlight the potential of this novel adaptive, learning-based framework to assist in the model specification process."

In this work, we first empirically demonstrate the presence of SB in ECG analyses and its negative impact on diagnostic performance, while simultaneously discovering that self-supervised learning (SSL) can alleviate it, providing a promising direction for tackling the bias. Following the SSL paradigm, we propose a novel method comprising two key components: 1) Temporal-Frequency aware Filters to capture temporal-frequency features reflecting the dynamic characteristics of ECG signals, and 2) building on this, Multi-Grained Prototype Reconstruction for coarse and fine representation learning across dual domains, further mitigating SB. To advance SSL in ECG analyses, we curate a large-scale multi-site ECG dataset with 1.53 million recordings from over 300 clinical centers. Experiments on three downstream tasks across six ECG datasets demonstrate that our method effectively reduces SB and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

However, while recent studies show promising results, many approaches rely on complex architectures or require content data, which may not always be available. This paper presents Interact2Vec, a novel neural network-based model that simultaneously learns distributed embeddings for users and items while demanding only implicit feedback. The model employs state-of-the-art strategies that natural language processing models commonly use to optimize the training phase and enhance the final embeddings. Two types of experiments were conducted regarding the extrinsic and intrinsic quality of the model. In the former, we benchmarked the recommendations generated by Interact2Vec's embeddings in a top-$N$ ranking problem, comparing them with six other recommender algorithms. The model achieved the second or third-best results in 30% of the datasets, being competitive with other recommenders, and has proven to be very efficient with an average training time reduction of 274% compared to other embedding-based models. Later, we analyzed the intrinsic quality of the embeddings through similarity tables. Our findings suggest that Interact2Vec can achieve promising results, especially on the extrinsic task, and is an excellent embedding-generator model for scenarios of scarce computing resources, enabling the learning of item and user embeddings simultaneously and efficiently."

IMMP follows a two-step process: pre-merging to capture agent behaviors and interactions, sufficiently extracting diverse information from the source domain, followed by merging to construct an adaptable model that efficiently transfers diverse interactions to the target domain. Our method is evaluated on various planning benchmarks and models, demonstrating superior performance compared to conventional approaches."

However, they often lack an explicit and systematic framework for quantifying the contribution of individual features. Building on the Taylor expansion framework introduced by Deng et al. (2024) to unify existing local attribution methods, we propose a rigorous set of postulates -- \"precision\", \"federation\", and \"zero-discrepancy\" -- to govern Taylor term-specific attribution. Guided by these postulates, we introduce TaylorPODA (Taylor expansion-derived imPortance-Order aDapted Attribution), which incorporates an additional \"adaptation\" property. This property enables alignment with task-specific goals, especially in post-hoc settings lacking ground-truth explanations. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that TaylorPODA achieves competitive results against baseline methods, providing principled and visualization-friendly explanations. This work represents a step toward the trustworthy deployment of opaque models by offering explanations with stronger theoretical grounding."

The world is arguably made up, not of pixels, words, and phonemes but of entities (objects, things, including events) with properties and relations among them. Surely we should model these, not the perception or description of them. You might suspect that concentrating on modeling words and pixels is because all of the (valuable) data in the world is in terms of text and images. If you look into almost any company you will find their most valuable data is in spreadsheets, databases and other relational formats. These are not the form that are studied in introductory machine learning, but are full of product numbers, student numbers, transaction numbers and other identifiers that can't be interpreted naively as numbers. The field that studies this sort of data has various names including relational learning, statistical relational AI, and many others. This paper explains why relational learning is not taking over the world -- except in a few cases with restricted relations -- and what needs to be done to bring it to it's rightful prominence."

It may also help infer genetic clusters, reducing reliance on expensive testing. This study systematically evaluates anatomical priors to identify configurations that improve deep learning-based PCC segmentation. We employed the nnU-Net framework to evaluate eleven annotation strategies for accurate 3D segmentation of pheochromocytoma, introducing a set of novel multi-class schemes based on organ-specific anatomical priors. These priors were derived from adjacent organs commonly surrounding adrenal tumors (e.g., liver, spleen, kidney, aorta, adrenal gland, and pancreas), and were compared against a broad body-region prior used in previous work. The framework was trained and tested on 105 contrast-enhanced CT scans from 91 patients at the NIH Clinical Center. Performance was measured using Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), Normalized Surface Distance (NSD), and instance-wise F1 score. Among all strategies, the Tumor + Kidney + Aorta (TKA) annotation achieved the highest segmentation accuracy, significantly outperforming the previously used Tumor + Body (TB) annotation across DSC (p = 0.0097), NSD (p = 0.0110), and F1 score (25.84% improvement at an IoU threshold of 0.5), measured on a 70-30 train-test split. The TKA model also showed superior tumor burden quantification (R^2 = 0.968) and strong segmentation across all genetic subtypes. In five-fold cross-validation, TKA consistently outperformed TB across IoU thresholds (0.1 to 0.5), reinforcing its robustness and generalizability. These findings highlight the value of incorporating relevant anatomical context into deep learning models to achieve precise PCC segmentation, offering a valuable tool to support clinical assessment and longitudinal disease monitoring in PCC patients."

By endowing the open set with a Riemannian metric induced by a barrier function, we obtain a Riemannian subgradient flow formulated as a differential inclusion, which remains strictly within the interior of the feasible set. This continuous dynamical system unifies two classes of iterative optimization methods, namely the Hessian barrier method and mirror descent scheme, by revealing that these methods can be interpreted as discrete approximations of the continuous flow. We explore the long-term behavior of the trajectories generated by this dynamical system and show that the existing deficient convergence properties of the Hessian barrier and mirror descent scheme can be unifily and more insightfully interpreted through these of the continuous trajectory. For instance, the notorious spurious stationary points \\cite{chen2024spurious} observed in Hessian barrier method and mirror descent scheme are interpreted as stable equilibria of the dynamical system that do not correspond to real stationary points of the original optimization problem. We provide two sufficient condition such that these spurious stationary points can be avoided if the strict complementarity conditions holds. In the absence of these regularity condition, we propose a random perturbation strategy that ensures the trajectory converges (subsequentially) to an approximate stationary point. Building on these insights, we introduce two iterative Riemannian subgradient methods, form of interior point methods, that generalizes the existing Hessian barrier method and mirror descent scheme for solving nonsmooth nonconvex optimization problems."

Recent hybrid CNN-Transformer architectures achieve state-of-the-art results but add significant complexity. In this paper, we propose MLRU++, a Multiscale Lightweight Residual UNETR++ architecture designed to balance segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency. It introduces two key innovations: a Lightweight Channel and Bottleneck Attention Module (LCBAM) that enhances contextual feature encoding with minimal overhead, and a Multiscale Bottleneck Block (M2B) in the decoder that captures fine-grained details via multi-resolution feature aggregation. Experiments on four publicly available benchmark datasets (Synapse, BTCV, ACDC, and Decathlon Lung) demonstrate that MLRU++ achieves state-of-the-art performance, with average Dice scores of 87.57% (Synapse), 93.00% (ACDC), and 81.12% (Lung). Compared to existing leading models, MLRU++ improves Dice scores by 5.38% and 2.12% on Synapse and ACDC, respectively, while significantly reducing parameter count and computational cost. Ablation studies evaluating LCBAM and M2B further confirm the effectiveness of the proposed architectural components.

These tools are not tailored for particular operations, making their longevity highly sensitive to how they are used. This creates a fundamental challenge: how can a robot learn a tool-use policy that both completes the task and prolongs the tool's lifespan? In this work, we address this challenge by introducing a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that incorporates tool lifespan as a factor during policy optimization. Our framework leverages Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and Miner's Rule to estimate Remaining Useful Life (RUL) based on accumulated stress, and integrates the RUL into the RL reward to guide policy learning toward lifespan-guided behavior. To handle the fact that RUL can only be estimated after task execution, we introduce an Adaptive Reward Normalization (ARN) mechanism that dynamically adjusts reward scaling based on estimated RULs, ensuring stable learning signals. We validate our method across simulated and real-world tool use tasks, including Object-Moving and Door-Opening with multiple general-purpose tools. The learned policies consistently prolong tool lifespan (up to 8.01x in simulation) and transfer effectively to real-world settings, demonstrating the practical value of learning lifespan-guided tool use strategies."

Training relies on a composite MSE-correlation loss and a curriculum that gradually shifts emphasis from early sensory to late association regions. Averaging 100 model variants further boosts robustness. The resulting system ranked third on the competition leaderboard, achieving an overall Pearson r = 0.2094 and the highest single-parcel peak score (mean r = 0.63) among all participants, with particularly strong gains for the most challenging subject (Subject 5).

Hence, existing approaches are trained on limited sets of MRI sequences, which might limit their generalizability. To characterize the landscape of MRI abdominal segmentation tools, we present here a comprehensive benchmarking of the three state-of-the-art and open-source models: MRSegmentator, MRISegmentator-Abdomen, and TotalSegmentator MRI. Since these models are trained using labor-intensive manual annotation cycles, we also introduce and evaluate ABDSynth, a SynthSeg-based model purely trained on widely available CT segmentations (no real images). More generally, we assess accuracy and generalizability by leveraging three public datasets (not seen by any of the evaluated methods during their training), which span all major manufacturers, five MRI sequences, as well as a variety of subject conditions, voxel resolutions, and fields-of-view. Our results reveal that MRSegmentator achieves the best performance and is most generalizable. In contrast, ABDSynth yields slightly less accurate results, but its relaxed requirements in training data make it an alternative when the annotation budget is limited.

Nevertheless, existing methods have three key limitations: (1) coarse semantic granularity in constraint modeling, (2) lack of real-time closed-loop planning, (3) compromised robustness in semantically diverse environments. To address these challenges, we propose ReSem3D, a unified manipulation framework for semantically diverse environments, leveraging the synergy between VFMs and MLLMs to achieve fine-grained visual grounding and dynamically constructs hierarchical 3D spatial constraints for real-time manipulation. Specifically, the framework is driven by hierarchical recursive reasoning in MLLMs, which interact with VFMs to automatically construct 3D spatial constraints from natural language instructions and RGB-D observations in two stages: part-level extraction and region-level refinement. Subsequently, these constraints are encoded as real-time optimization objectives in joint space, enabling reactive behavior to dynamic disturbances. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments are conducted in semantically rich household and sparse chemical lab environments. The results demonstrate that ReSem3D performs diverse manipulation tasks under zero-shot conditions, exhibiting strong adaptability and generalization.

Through experiments on synthetic and real-world data, we find that (1) harnessing more modalities usually improves ASR accuracy, as each modality provides complementary information, but the improvement depends on the amount of auditory noise. (2) Synchronized modalities (e.g., lip movements) are more useful at high noise levels whereas unsynchronized modalities (e.g., image context) are most helpful at moderate noise levels. (3) Higher-quality visual representations consistently improve ASR accuracy, highlighting the importance of developing more powerful visual encoders.

These distortions include background noise, reverberation, bandwidth limitations, signal clipping, and network packet loss. Existing methods typically focus on optimizing for a single type of distortion, often struggling to effectively handle the simultaneous presence of multiple distortions in complex scenarios. OmniGSE bridges this gap by integrating the strengths of discriminative and generative approaches through a two-stage architecture that enables cross-domain collaborative optimization. In the first stage, continuous features are enhanced using a lightweight channel-split NAC-RoFormer. In the second stage, discrete tokens are generated to reconstruct high-quality speech through language models. Specifically, we designed a hierarchical language model structure consisting of a RootLM and multiple BranchLMs. The RootLM models general acoustic features across codebook layers, while the BranchLMs explicitly capture the progressive relationships between different codebook levels. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniGSE surpasses existing models across multiple benchmarks, particularly excelling in scenarios involving compound distortions. These findings underscore the framework's potential for robust and versatile speech enhancement in real-world applications."

This has sparked interest in automatic personality perception (APP), which aims to predict an individual's perceived personality traits. Previous studies in APP have treated personalities as static traits, independent of context. However, perceived personalities can vary by context and situation as shown in psychological research. In this study, we investigate the relationship between conversational speech and perceived personality for participants engaged in two work situations (a neutral interview and a stressful client interaction). Our key findings are: 1) perceived personalities differ significantly across interactions, 2) loudness, sound level, and spectral flux features are indicative of perceived extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness in neutral interactions, while neuroticism correlates with these features in stressful contexts, 3) handcrafted acoustic features and non-verbal features outperform speaker embeddings in inference of perceived personality, and 4) stressful interactions are more predictive of neuroticism, aligning with existing psychological research."

Our approach creates a \"granular codebook\" by encoding a source audio corpus into latent vector segments, then matches each latent grain of a target audio signal to its closest counterpart in the codebook. The resulting hybrid sequence is decoded to produce audio that preserves the target's temporal structure while adopting the source's timbral characteristics. This technique requires no model training, works with diverse audio materials, and naturally avoids the discontinuities typical of traditional concatenative synthesis through the codec's implicit interpolation during decoding.

Prior work can be categorized into two frameworks. Bottom-up methods first determine boundaries and then cluster the fixed segmented words into a lexicon. In contrast, top-down methods incorporate information from the clustered words to inform boundary selection. However, it is unclear whether top-down information is necessary to improve segmentation. To explore this, we look at two similar approaches that differ in whether top-down clustering informs boundary selection. Our simple bottom-up strategy predicts word boundaries using the dissimilarity between adjacent self-supervised features, then clusters the resulting segments to construct a lexicon. Our top-down system is an updated version of the ES-KMeans dynamic programming method that iteratively uses K-means to update its boundaries. On the five-language ZeroSpeech benchmarks, both approaches achieve comparable state-of-the-art results, with the bottom-up system being nearly five times faster. Through detailed analyses, we show that the top-down influence of ES-KMeans can be beneficial (depending on factors like the candidate boundaries), but in many cases the simple bottom-up method performs just as well. For both methods, we show that the clustering step is a limiting factor. Therefore, we recommend that future work focus on improved clustering techniques and learning more discriminative word-like representations.

However, many proposed DNN-based speech enhancement algorithms cannot be implemented on devices with limited hardware resources. Only lowering the complexity of such systems by reducing the number of parameters often results in worse performance. Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a promising approach for reducing DNN model size while preserving performance. In this paper, we consider the recently proposed Frequency-Time Joint Non-linear Filter (FT-JNF) architecture and investigate several KD methods to train smaller (student) models from a large pre-trained (teacher) model. Five KD methods are evaluated using direct output matching, the self-similarity of intermediate layers, and fused multi-layer losses. Experimental results on a simulated dataset using a compact array with five microphones show that three KD methods substantially improve the performance of student models compared to training without KD. A student model with only 25% of the teacher model's parameters achieves comparable PESQ scores at 0 dB SNR. Furthermore, a reduction of up to 96% in model size can be achieved with only a minimal decrease in PESQ scores."

Notably, our method does not rely on speaker embeddings, making it speaker-independent and enabling strong generalization across multiple speech datasets in different languages.\n  We employ a fully complex-valued neural network that operates directly on the complex-valued Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) of the mixed audio signals. This deviates from conventional approaches that use spectrograms or treat the real and imaginary components of the STFT as separate real-valued inputs.\n  We first evaluate the method in an anechoic, noise-free scenario, where it demonstrates excellent extraction performance while effectively preserving the binaural cues of the target signal. We then test a modified variant under mild reverberation conditions. This version remains robust in reverberant environments, maintaining speech clarity, preserving source directionality, and simultaneously reducing reverberation."

To address this issue, CatchPhrase generates enriched cross-modal semantic prompts (EXPrompt Mining) from weak class labels by leveraging large language models (LLMs) and audio captioning models (ACMs). To address both class-level and instance-level misalignment, we apply multi-modal filtering and retrieval to select the most semantically aligned prompt for each audio sample (EXPrompt Selector). A lightweight mapping network is then trained to adapt pre-trained text-to-image generation models to audio input.

IP broadcasting allows for the transport of audio and video signals in an easily configurable way, aligning with modern networking techniques. This shift towards an IP workflow allows for much greater flexibility, not only in routing signals but with the integration of tools using standard web development techniques. One possible tool could include the use of live audio tagging, which has a number of uses in the production of content. These could include adding sound effects to automated closed captioning or identifying unwanted sound events within a scene. In this paper, we describe the process of containerising an audio tagging model into a microservice, a small segregated code module that can be integrated into a multitude of different network setups. The goal is to develop a modular, accessible, and flexible tool capable of seamless deployment into broadcasting workflows of all sizes, from small productions to large corporations. Challenges surrounding latency of the selected audio tagging model and its effect on the usefulness of the end product are discussed."

SSL frameworks rely on anchor-positive pairs, constructed from segments of the same audio utterance. Hence, positives have channel characteristics similar to those of their corresponding anchors, even with extensive data-augmentation. Therefore, this positive sampling strategy is a fundamental limitation as it encodes too much information regarding the recording source in the learned representations. This article introduces Self-Supervised Positive Sampling (SSPS), a bootstrapped technique for sampling appropriate and diverse positives in SSL frameworks for SV. SSPS samples positives close to their anchor in the representation space, assuming that these pseudo-positives belong to the same speaker identity but correspond to different recording conditions. This method consistently demonstrates improvements in SV performance on VoxCeleb benchmarks when applied to major SSL frameworks, including SimCLR, SwAV, VICReg, and DINO. Using SSPS, SimCLR and DINO achieve 2.57% and 2.53% EER on VoxCeleb1-O, respectively. SimCLR yields a 58% relative reduction in EER, getting comparable performance to DINO with a simpler training framework. Furthermore, SSPS lowers intra-class variance and reduces channel information in speaker representations while exhibiting greater robustness without data-augmentation."

A popular method to estimate the TDOA between a microphone pair involves maximizing a generalized cross-correlation with phase transform (GCC-PHAT) function. Since the TDOAs across different microphone pairs satisfy consistency relations, generally only a small subset of microphone pairs are used for source position estimation. Although the set of microphone pairs is often determined based on a reference microphone, recently a more robust method has been proposed to determine the set of microphone pairs by computing the minimum spanning tree (MST) of a signal graph of GCC-PHAT function reliabilities. To reduce the influence of noise and reverberation on the TDOA estimation accuracy, in this paper we propose to compute the GCC-PHAT functions of the MST based on an average of multiple cross-power spectral densities (CPSDs) using an incremental method. In each step of the method, we increase the number of CPSDs over which we average by considering CPSDs computed indirectly via other microphones from previous steps. Using signals recorded in a noisy and reverberant laboratory with an array of spatially distributed microphones, the performance of the proposed method is evaluated in terms of TDOA estimation error and 2D source position estimation error. Experimental results for different source and microphone configurations and three reverberation conditions show that the proposed method considering multiple CPSDs improves the TDOA estimation and source position estimation accuracy compared to the reference microphone- and MST-based methods that rely on a single CPSD as well as steered-response power-based source position estimation."

Using a pretrained streaming encoder for user input enables the first duplex S2S model without requiring speech pretrain. Separate architectures for agent and user modeling facilitate codec fine-tuning for better agent voices and halve the bitrate (0.6 kbps) compared to previous works. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms previous duplex models in reasoning, turn-taking, and barge-in abilities.

Our unified framework leverages Mamba, a selective state space model (SSM), while integrating phonological features and think token strategies to jointly enhance interpretability and fine-grained temporal reasoning in APA and MDD. To our knowledge, this is the first study to combine phonological attribution, SSM-based modeling, and prompting in CAPT. A series of experiments conducted on the speechocean762 benchmark demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms prior methods, particularly on the MDD task."

        "summary": "arXiv:2507.18119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Recent advances in end-to-end spoken language models (SLMs) have significantly improved the ability of AI systems to engage in natural spoken interactions. However, most existing models treat speech merely as a vehicle for linguistic content, often overlooking the rich paralinguistic and speaker characteristic cues embedded in human speech, such as dialect, age, emotion, and non-speech vocalizations. In this work, we introduce GOAT-SLM, a novel spoken language model with paralinguistic and speaker characteristic awareness, designed to extend spoken language modeling beyond text semantics. GOAT-SLM adopts a dual-modality head architecture that decouples linguistic modeling from acoustic realization, enabling robust language understanding while supporting expressive and adaptive speech generation. To enhance model efficiency and versatility, we propose a modular, staged training strategy that progressively aligns linguistic, paralinguistic, and speaker characteristic information using large-scale speech-text corpora. Experimental results on TELEVAL, a multi-dimensional evaluation benchmark, demonstrate that GOAT-SLM achieves well-balanced performance across both semantic and non-semantic tasks, and outperforms existing open-source models in handling emotion, dialectal variation, and age-sensitive interactions. This work highlights the importance of modeling beyond linguistic content and advances the development of more natural, adaptive, and socially aware spoken language systems."
