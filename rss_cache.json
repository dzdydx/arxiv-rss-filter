        "summary": "arXiv:2507.15862v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This paper introduces the Comprehensive Applicant Profile Score (CAPS), a novel multi-modal framework designed to quantitatively model and interpret holistic college admissions evaluations. CAPS decomposes applicant profiles into three interpretable components: academic performance (Standardized Academic Score, SAS), essay quality (Essay Quality Index, EQI), and extracurricular engagement (Extracurricular Impact Score, EIS). Leveraging transformer-based semantic embeddings, LLM scoring, and XGBoost regression, CAPS provides transparent and explainable evaluations aligned with human judgment. Experiments on a synthetic but realistic dataset demonstrate strong performance, achieving an EQI prediction R^2 of 0.80, classification accuracy over 75%, a macro F1 score of 0.69, and a weighted F1 score of 0.74. CAPS addresses key limitations in traditional holistic review -- particularly the opacity, inconsistency, and anxiety faced by applicants -- thus paving the way for more equitable and data-informed admissions practices."

Designed and implemented by eSapiens, the system ingests heterogeneous content (PDF, Office, web), splits it into 1,000-token overlapping chunks, and indexes them in a hybrid HNSW+BM25 store. User queries are refined by GPT-4o, retrieved via combined vector+BM25 search, reranked with Cohere, and answered by an LLM using CO-STAR prompt engineering. A LangGraph verifier enforces citation overlap, regenerating answers until every claim is grounded. On four LegalBench subsets, 1000-token chunks improve Recall@50 by approximately 1 pp and hybrid+rerank boosts Precision@10 by approximately 7 pp; the verifier raises TRACe Utilization above 0.50 and limits unsupported statements to less than 3%. All components run in containers, enforce end-to-end TLS 1.3 and AES-256. These results demonstrate that the DEREK module delivers accurate, traceable, and production-ready document QA with minimal operational overhead. The module is designed to meet enterprise demands for secure, auditable, and context-faithful retrieval, providing a reliable baseline for high-stakes domains such as legal and finance."

Secondly, we show that the NER tagger's ability to reference demonstration examples is generally inadequate. We propose a demonstration and training approach that effectively addresses these issues. For the first issue, we propose to select examples by dual similarity, which comprises both semantic similarity and feature similarity. For the second issue, we propose to train an NER model with adversarial demonstration such that the model is forced to refer to the demonstrations when performing the tagging task. We conduct comprehensive experiments in low-resource NER tasks, and the results demonstrate that our method outperforms a range of methods."

We present Rare Disease Mining Agents (RDMA), a framework that mirrors how medical experts identify rare disease patterns in EHR. RDMA connects scattered clinical observations that together suggest specific rare conditions. By handling clinical abbreviations, recognizing implicit disease patterns, and applying contextual reasoning locally on standard hardware, RDMA reduces privacy risks while improving F1 performance by upwards of 30\\% and decreasing inferences costs 10-fold. This approach helps clinicians avoid the privacy risk of using cloud services while accessing key rare disease information from EHR systems, supporting earlier diagnosis for rare disease patients.

To probe where useful robustness ends and harmful insensitivity begins, we compile 50 LeetCode problems and craft three minimal prompt perturbations that should vary in importance: (i) progressive underspecification deleting 10 % of words per step; (ii) lexical flip swapping a pivotal quantifier (\"max\" to \"min\"); and (iii) jargon inflation replacing a common noun with an obscure technical synonym. Six frontier models, including three \"reasoning-tuned\" versions, solve each mutated prompt, and their Python outputs are checked against the original test suites to reveal whether they reused the baseline solution or adapted. Among 11 853 generations we observe a sharp double asymmetry. Models remain correct in 85 % of cases even after 90 % of the prompt is missing, showing over-robustness to underspecification, yet only 54 % react to a single quantifier flip that reverses the task, with reasoning-tuned variants even less sensitive than their bases. Jargon edits lie in between, passing through 56 %. Current LLMs thus blur the line between harmless noise and meaning - changing edits, often treating both as ignorable. Masking salient anchors such as function names can force re - evaluation. We advocate evaluation and training protocols that reward differential sensitivity: stay steady under benign noise but adapt - or refuse - when semantics truly change."

Here we describe a dataset of neural networks, designed for the purpose of hypernetworks research. The dataset includes $10^4$ LeNet-5 neural networks trained for binary image classification separated into 10 classes, such that each class contains 1,000 different neural networks that can identify a certain ImageNette V2 class from all other classes. A computing cluster of over $10^4$ cores was used to generate the dataset. Basic classification results show that the neural networks can be classified with accuracy of 72.0%, indicating that the differences between the neural networks can be identified by supervised machine learning algorithms. The ultimate purpose of the dataset is to enable hypernetworks research. The dataset and the code that generates it are open and accessible to the public."

This paper presents the first comprehensive evaluation of Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO) methods for real-world, high-stakes multiclass classification in a commercial setting, addressing a critical gap in the existing literature where most of the APO frameworks have been validated only on benchmark classification tasks of limited complexity.\n  We introduce APE-OPRO, a novel hybrid framework that combines the complementary strengths of APE and OPRO, achieving notably better cost-efficiency, around $18\\%$ improvement over OPRO, without sacrificing performance. We benchmark APE-OPRO alongside both gradient-free (APE, OPRO) and gradient-based (ProTeGi) methods on a dataset of ~2,500 labeled products.\n  Our results highlight key trade-offs: ProTeGi offers the strongest absolute performance at lower API cost but higher computational time as noted in~\\cite{protegi}, while APE-OPRO strikes a compelling balance between performance, API efficiency, and scalability. We further conduct ablation studies on depth and breadth hyperparameters, and reveal notable sensitivity to label formatting, indicating implicit sensitivity in LLM behavior. These findings provide actionable insights for implementing APO in commercial applications and establish a foundation for future research in multi-label, vision, and multimodal prompt optimization scenarios."

This reliance on a multi-step process originates from the factorization approximation of DFMs, which is necessary for handling high-dimensional data. In this paper, we rigorously characterize the approximation error from factorization using Conditional Total Correlation (TC), which depends on the coupling. To reduce the Conditional TC and enable efficient few-step generation, we propose Rectified Discrete Flow (ReDi), a novel iterative method that reduces factorization error by rectifying the coupling between source and target distributions. We theoretically prove that each ReDi step guarantees a monotonic decreasing Conditional TC, ensuring its convergence. Empirically, ReDi significantly reduces Conditional TC and enables few-step generation. Moreover, we demonstrate that the rectified couplings are well-suited for training efficient one-step models on image generation. ReDi offers a simple and theoretically grounded approach for tackling the few-step challenge, providing a new perspective on efficient discrete data synthesis.

In this paper, we investigate this issue by drawing insight from high dimensional statistics: in these regimes, the latent vectors of a standard VAE are by construction distributed uniformly on a hypersphere. We propose to formulate the latent variables of a VAE using hyperspherical coordinates, which allows compressing the latent vectors towards an island on the hypersphere, thereby reducing the latent sparsity and we show that this improves the generation ability of the VAE. We propose a new parameterization of the latent space with limited computational overhead."

However, hallucinations generated by LLMs-where outputs are inconsistent with facts-pose a significant challenge, undermining the credibility of intelligent agents. Only if hallucinations can be mitigated, the intelligent agents can be used in real-world without any catastrophic risk. Therefore, effective detection and mitigation of hallucinations are crucial to ensure the dependability of agents. Unfortunately, the related approaches either depend on white-box access to LLMs or fail to accurately identify hallucinations. To address the challenge posed by hallucinations of intelligent agents, we present HalMit, a novel black-box watchdog framework that models the generalization bound of LLM-empowered agents and thus detect hallucinations without requiring internal knowledge of the LLM's architecture. Specifically, a probabilistic fractal sampling technique is proposed to generate a sufficient number of queries to trigger the incredible responses in parallel, efficiently identifying the generalization bound of the target agent. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that HalMit significantly outperforms existing approaches in hallucination monitoring. Its black-box nature and superior performance make HalMit a promising solution for enhancing the dependability of LLM-powered systems."

However, optimizing policies with respect to a single reward model estimate can render it vulnerable to inaccuracies in the reward model. We empirically study the variability of reward model training on open-source benchmarks. We observe that independently trained reward models on the same preference dataset can exhibit substantial disagreement, highlighting the instability of current alignment strategies. Employing a theoretical model, we demonstrate that variability in reward model estimation can cause overfitting, leading to the risk of performance degradation. To mitigate this risk, we propose a variance-aware policy optimization framework for preference-based alignment. The key ingredient of the framework is a new policy regularizer that incorporates reward model variance estimates. We show that variance-aware policy optimization provably reduces the risk of outputting a worse policy than the default. Experiments across diverse LLM and reward model configurations confirm that our approach yields more stable and robust alignment than the standard (variance-unaware) pipeline."

We review historical precedents, from inverted and meta-Turing variants to modern supervised reverse-Turing classifiers, and highlight the novelty of combining quality thresholds, phased difficulty levels, and minimax bounds. We then formalize the dual test: define the judge's task over N independent rounds with fresh prompts drawn from a prompt space Q, introduce a quality function Q and parameters tau and delta, and cast the interaction as a two-player zero-sum game over the adversary's feasible strategy set M. Next, we map this minimax game onto an RL-HF style alignment loop, in which an undetectability detector D provides negative reward for stealthy outputs, balanced by a quality proxy that preserves fluency. Throughout, we include detailed explanations of each component notation, the meaning of inner minimization over sequences, phased tests, and iterative adversarial training and conclude with a suggestion for a couple of immediate actions."

Despite the advances, existing studies have yet to delve thoroughly into fine-grained relationships within logit knowledge. In this paper, we propose Local Dense Relational Logit Distillation (LDRLD), a novel method that captures inter-class relationships through recursively decoupling and recombining logit information, thereby providing more detailed and clearer insights for student learning. To further optimize the performance, we introduce an Adaptive Decay Weight (ADW) strategy, which can dynamically adjust the weights for critical category pairs using Inverse Rank Weighting (IRW) and Exponential Rank Decay (ERD). Specifically, IRW assigns weights inversely proportional to the rank differences between pairs, while ERD adaptively controls weight decay based on total ranking scores of category pairs. Furthermore, after the recursive decoupling, we distill the remaining non-target knowledge to ensure knowledge completeness and enhance performance. Ultimately, our method improves the student's performance by transferring fine-grained knowledge and emphasizing the most critical relationships. Extensive experiments on datasets such as CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1K, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that our method compares favorably with state-of-the-art logit-based distillation approaches.

        "summary": "arXiv:2507.15915v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Context: Mpox is a zoonotic disease caused by the Mpox virus, which shares similarities with other skin conditions, making accurate early diagnosis challenging. Artificial intelligence (AI), especially Deep Learning (DL), has a strong tool for medical image analysis; however, pre-trained models like CNNs and XAI techniques for mpox detection is underexplored. Objective: This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of pre-trained CNN models (VGG16, VGG19, InceptionV3, MobileNetV2) for the early detection of monkeypox using binary and multi-class datasets. It also seeks to enhance model interpretability using Grad-CAM an XAI technique. Method: Two datasets, MSLD and MSLD v2.0, were used for training and validation. Transfer learning techniques were applied to fine-tune pre-trained CNN models by freezing initial layers and adding custom layers for adapting the final features for mpox detection task and avoid overfitting. Models performance were evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score and ROC. Grad-CAM was utilized for visualizing critical features. Results: InceptionV3 demonstrated the best performance on the binary dataset with an accuracy of 95%, while MobileNetV2 outperformed on the multi-class dataset with an accuracy of 93%. Grad-CAM successfully highlighted key image regions. Despite high accuracy, some models showed overfitting tendencies, as videnced by discrepancies between training and validation losses. Conclusion: This study underscores the potential of pre-trained CNN models in monkeypox detection and the value of XAI techniques. Future work should address dataset limitations, incorporate multimodal data, and explore additional interpretability techniques to improve diagnostic reliability and model transparency"

A primary bottleneck in realizing this potential is the difficulty of automating KG construction, which faces challenges related to output reliability, consistency, and verifiability. These issues can manifest as structural inconsistencies within the generated graphs, such as the formation of disconnected $\\textit{isolated islands}$ of data or the inaccurate conflation of abstract classes with specific instances. To address these challenges, we propose HyDRA, a $\\textbf{Hy}$brid-$\\textbf{D}$riven $\\textbf{R}$easoning $\\textbf{A}$rchitecture designed for verifiable KG automation. Given a domain or an initial set of documents, HyDRA first constructs an ontology via a panel of collaborative neurosymbolic agents. These agents collaboratively agree on a set of competency questions (CQs) that define the scope and requirements the ontology must be able to answer. Given these CQs, we build an ontology graph that subsequently guides the automated extraction of triplets for KG generation from arbitrary documents. Inspired by design-by-contracts (DbC) principles, our method leverages verifiable contracts as the primary control mechanism to steer the generative process of Large Language Models (LLMs). To verify the output of our approach, we extend beyond standard benchmarks and propose an evaluation framework that assesses the functional correctness of the resulting KG by leveraging symbolic verifications as described by the neurosymbolic AI framework, $\\textit{SymbolicAI}$. This work contributes a hybrid-driven architecture for improving the reliability of automated KG construction and the exploration of evaluation methods for measuring the functional integrity of its output.

Low-quality face images, often caused by factors such as motion blur, poor lighting conditions, occlusions, and extreme pose variations, significantly degrade the performance of face recognition models, leading to higher false rejection and false acceptance rates. In this work, we propose a lightweight yet effective framework for automatic face quality assessment, which aims to pre-filter low-quality face images before they are passed to the verification pipeline. Our approach utilises normalised facial landmarks in conjunction with a Random Forest Regression classifier to assess image quality, achieving an accuracy of 96.67\\%. By integrating this quality assessment module into the face verification process, we observe a substantial improvement in performance, including a comfortable 99.7\\% reduction in the false rejection rate and enhanced cosine similarity scores when paired with the ArcFace face verification model. To validate our approach, we have conducted experiments on a real-world dataset collected comprising over 600 subjects captured from CCTV footage in unconstrained environments within Dubai Police. Our results demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively mitigates the impact of poor-quality face images, outperforming existing face quality assessment techniques while maintaining computational efficiency. Moreover, the framework specifically addresses two critical challenges in real-time screening: variations in face resolution and pose deviations, both of which are prevalent in practical surveillance scenarios."

While several model interpretation approaches exist, such as circuit discovery, Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have proven particularly effective in decomposing a model's activation space into its feature basis. In this work, we explore the differences in SAEs for the original and compressed models. We find that SAEs trained on the original model can interpret the compressed model albeit with slight performance degradation compared to the trained SAE on the compressed model. Furthermore, simply pruning the original SAE itself achieves performance comparable to training a new SAE on the pruned model. This finding enables us to mitigate the extensive training costs of SAEs."

However, conventional Gaussian Process (GP) calibration methods often fail to capture the internal hierarchical structure of deep neural networks, limiting both interpretability and effectiveness for assessing predictive reliability. We propose a Semantic-Aware Layer-wise Gaussian Process (SAL-GP) framework that mirrors the layered architecture of the target neural network. Instead of applying a single global GP correction, SAL-GP employs a multi-layer GP model, where each layer's feature representation is mapped to a local calibration correction. These layerwise GPs are coupled through a structured multi-layer kernel, enabling joint marginalization across all layers. This design allows SAL-GP to capture both local semantic dependencies and global calibration coherence, while consistently propagating predictive uncertainty through the network. The resulting framework enhances interpretability aligned with the network architecture and enables principled evaluation of confidence consistency and uncertainty quantification in deep models."

Namely at inference time an LLM is able to learn new patterns without any additional weight update when these patterns are presented in the form of examples in the prompt, even if these patterns were not seen during training. The mechanisms through which this can happen are still largely unknown. In this work, we show that the stacking of a self-attention layer with an MLP, allows the transformer block to implicitly modify the weights of the MLP layer according to the context. We argue through theory and experimentation that this simple mechanism may be the reason why LLMs can learn in context and not only during training. Specifically, we show under mild simplifying assumptions how a transformer block implicitly transforms a context into a low-rank weight-update of the MLP layer."

Unlike the garment-to-person try-on task, the person-to-person task only involves two input images: one depicting the target person and the other showing the garment worn by a different individual. The goal is to generate a realistic combination of the target person with the desired garment. To this end, we propose Flattening-and-Warping Virtual Try-On (\\textbf{FW-VTON}), a method that operates in three stages: (1) extracting the flattened garment image from the source image; (2) warping the garment to align with the target pose; and (3) integrating the warped garment seamlessly onto the target person. To overcome the challenges posed by the lack of high-quality datasets for this task, we introduce a new dataset specifically designed for person-to-person try-on scenarios. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that FW-VTON achieves state-of-the-art performance, with superior results in both qualitative and quantitative assessments, and also excels in garment extraction subtasks."

However, these claims are based on evaluations conducted across significantly different scenarios. Many of the challenging characteristics attributed to egocentric vision are also present in third person videos of human-object activities. This raises a critical question: how much of the observed performance drop stems from the unique first person viewpoint inherent to egocentric vision versus the domain of human-object activities? To address this question, we introduce a new benchmark study designed to disentangle such factors. Our evaluation strategy enables a more precise separation of challenges related to the first person perspective from those linked to the broader domain of human-object activity understanding.

In contrast, developmental psychology suggests that humans perceive the world in terms of Spelke objects--groupings of physical things that reliably move together when acted on by physical forces. Spelke objects thus operate on category-agnostic causal motion relationships which potentially better support tasks like manipulation and planning. In this paper, we first benchmark the Spelke object concept, introducing the SpelkeBench dataset that contains a wide variety of well-defined Spelke segments in natural images. Next, to extract Spelke segments from images algorithmically, we build SpelkeNet, a class of visual world models trained to predict distributions over future motions. SpelkeNet supports estimation of two key concepts for Spelke object discovery: (1) the motion affordance map, identifying regions likely to move under a poke, and (2) the expected-displacement map, capturing how the rest of the scene will move. These concepts are used for \"statistical counterfactual probing\", where diverse \"virtual pokes\" are applied on regions of high motion-affordance, and the resultant expected displacement maps are used define Spelke segments as statistical aggregates of correlated motion statistics. We find that SpelkeNet outperforms supervised baselines like SegmentAnything (SAM) on SpelkeBench. Finally, we show that the Spelke concept is practically useful for downstream applications, yielding superior performance on the 3DEditBench benchmark for physical object manipulation when used in a variety of off-the-shelf object manipulation models."

However, this body of work has been limited to the single task setting, where the data distribution is assumed constant over time.

Inspired by several works that find CNNs tend to focus more on high-frequency components (a.k.a. abstract features, e.g., texture, edge, etc.), we validate that transforming images in the high-frequency space also improves transferability. Based on this finding, we propose a balanced approach called Semantic and Abstract FEatures disRuption (SAFER). Specifically, SAFER conducts BLOCKMIX on the input image and SELF-MIX on the frequency spectrum when computing the weight matrix to highlight crucial features. By using such a weight matrix, we can direct the attacker to disrupt both semantic and abstract features, leading to improved transferability. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset also demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in boosting adversarial transferability."

Additionally, frequent in-person meetings produce inconsistent documentation -- official minutes, personal notes, presentations may or may not exist. Shared information therefore becomes hard to retrieve outside of the meeting, necessitating lengthy updates and high-frequency meeting schedules.\n  Generative Artificial Intelligence (genAI) models like Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit an impressive performance on spoken and written language processing. This motivates a practical usage of genAI for knowledge management in engineering departments: using genAI for transcribing meetings and integrating heterogeneous additional information sources into an easily usable format for ad-hoc searches.\n  We implement an end-to-end pipeline to automate the entire meeting documentation workflow in a proof-of-concept state: meetings are recorded and minutes are created by genAI. These are further made easily searchable through a chatbot interface. The core of our work is to test this genAI-based software tooling in a real-world engineering department and collect extensive survey data on both ethical and technical aspects. Direct feedback from this real-world setup points out both opportunities and risks: a) users agree that the effort for meetings could be significantly reduced with the help of genAI models, b) technical aspects are largely solved already, c) organizational aspects are crucial for a successful ethical usage of such a system."

Drawing inspiration from the iterative nature of human research, which involves cycles of searching, reasoning, and revision, we propose the Test-Time Diffusion Deep Researcher (TTD-DR). This novel framework conceptualizes research report generation as a diffusion process. TTD-DR initiates this process with a preliminary draft, an updatable skeleton that serves as an evolving foundation to guide the research direction. The draft is then iteratively refined through a \"denoising\" process, which is dynamically informed by a retrieval mechanism that incorporates external information at each step. The core process is further enhanced by a self-evolutionary algorithm applied to each component of the agentic workflow, ensuring the generation of high-quality context for the diffusion process. This draft-centric design makes the report writing process more timely and coherent while reducing information loss during the iterative search process. We demonstrate that our TTD-DR achieves state-of-the-art results on a wide array of benchmarks that require intensive search and multi-hop reasoning, significantly outperforming existing deep research agents."

Using five open-source LLMs, we systematically examine how different persona prompt strategies, specifically role adoption formats and demographic priming strategies, influence LLM simulations across 15 intersectional demographic groups in both open- and closed-ended tasks. Our findings show that LLMs struggle to simulate marginalized groups, particularly nonbinary, Hispanic, and Middle Eastern identities, but that the choice of demographic priming and role adoption strategy significantly impacts their portrayal. Specifically, we find that prompting in an interview-style format and name-based priming can help reduce stereotyping and improve alignment.

While ternary NNs demonstrate excellent performance in practical applications such as image recognition and natural language processing, their theoretical understanding remains insufficient. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the expressivity of ternary NNs from the perspective of the number of linear regions. Specifically, we evaluate the number of linear regions of ternary regression NNs with Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) for activation functions and prove that the number of linear regions increases polynomially with respect to network width and exponentially with respect to depth, similar to standard NNs. Moreover, we show that it suffices to either square the width or double the depth of ternary NNs to achieve a lower bound on the maximum number of linear regions comparable to that of general ReLU regression NNs. This provides a theoretical explanation, in some sense, for the practical success of ternary NNs."

However, prior work on merging in LLMs, particularly in natural language processing, has been limited to scenarios where each test example addresses only a single task. In this paper, we focus on on-device settings and study the problem of text-based compositional multi-tasking, where each test example involves the simultaneous execution of multiple tasks. For instance, generating a translated summary of a long text requires solving both translation and summarization tasks concurrently. To facilitate research in this setting, we propose a benchmark comprising four practically relevant compositional tasks. We also present an efficient method (Learnable Calibration) tailored for on-device applications, where computational resources are limited, emphasizing the need for solutions that are both resource-efficient and high-performing.

In this work, we propose to overcome these shortcomings through feedback-based fine-tuning of existing personalized generation methods, wherein, state-of-art detectors of pose, human-object-interaction, human facial recognition and human gaze-point estimation are used to refine the diffusion model. We also propose timestep-based inculcation of different feedback modules, depending upon whether the signal is low-level (such as human pose), or high-level (such as gaze point).

While task-specific adaptations and autoregressive models have sought to address these challenges, they remain constrained by computational inefficiency, catastrophic forgetting, or narrow applicability. In this work, we present Pusa, a groundbreaking paradigm that leverages vectorized timestep adaptation (VTA) to enable fine-grained temporal control within a unified video diffusion framework. Besides, VTA is a non-destructive adaptation, which means it fully preserves the capabilities of the base model. By finetuning the SOTA Wan2.1-T2V-14B model with VTA, we achieve unprecedented efficiency -- surpassing the performance of Wan-I2V-14B with $\\leq$ 1/200 of the training cost (\\$500 vs. $\\geq$ \\$100,000) and $\\leq$ 1/2500 of the dataset size (4K vs. $\\geq$ 10M samples). Pusa not only sets a new standard for image-to-video (I2V) generation, achieving a VBench-I2V total score of 87.32\\% (vs. 86.86\\% of Wan-I2V-14B), but also unlocks many zero-shot multi-task capabilities such as start-end frames and video extension -- all without task-specific training. Meanwhile, Pusa can still perform text-to-video generation. Mechanistic analyses reveal that our approach preserves the foundation model's generative priors while surgically injecting temporal dynamics, avoiding the combinatorial explosion inherent to vectorized timesteps. This work establishes a scalable, efficient, and versatile paradigm for next-generation video synthesis, democratizing high-fidelity video generation for research and industry alike.

In this paper, we propose LongSplat, an online real-time 3D Gaussian reconstruction framework designed for long-sequence image input. The core idea is a streaming update mechanism that incrementally integrates current-view observations while selectively compressing redundant historical Gaussians. Crucial to this mechanism is our Gaussian-Image Representation (GIR), a representation that encodes 3D Gaussian parameters into a structured, image-like 2D format. GIR simultaneously enables efficient fusion of current-view and historical Gaussians and identity-aware redundancy compression. These functions enable online reconstruction and adapt the model to long sequences without overwhelming memory or computational costs. Furthermore, we leverage an existing image compression method to guide the generation of more compact and higher-quality 3D Gaussians. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that LongSplat achieves state-of-the-art efficiency-quality trade-offs in real-time novel view synthesis, delivering real-time reconstruction while reducing Gaussian counts by 44\\% compared to existing per-pixel Gaussian prediction methods."

However, integrating RGB and DSM often faces two major limitations: increased computational complexity due to architectural redundancy, and degraded segmentation performance caused by modality misalignment. These issues undermine the efficiency and robustness of semantic segmentation, particularly in complex urban environments where precise multi-modal integration is essential. To overcome these limitations, we propose Asymmetric Multi-Modal Network (AMMNet), a novel asymmetric architecture that achieves robust and efficient semantic segmentation through three designs tailored for RGB-DSM input pairs. To reduce architectural redundancy, the Asymmetric Dual Encoder (ADE) module assigns representational capacity based on modality-specific characteristics, employing a deeper encoder for RGB imagery to capture rich contextual information and a lightweight encoder for DSM to extract sparse structural features. Besides, to facilitate modality alignment, the Asymmetric Prior Fuser (APF) integrates a modality-aware prior matrix into the fusion process, enabling the generation of structure-aware contextual features. Additionally, the Distribution Alignment (DA) module enhances cross-modal compatibility by aligning feature distributions through divergence minimization. Extensive experiments on the ISPRS Vaihingen and Potsdam datasets demonstrate that AMMNet attains state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy among multi-modal networks while reducing computational and memory requirements."

Although most methods aim to enhance the global receptive field by directly modifying Mamba's scanning mechanism, they tend to overlook the critical importance of local information in dense prediction tasks. Additionally, whether Mamba can effectively extract local features as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) do remains an open question that merits further investigation. In this paper, We propose a novel model, AtrousMamba, which effectively balances the extraction of fine-grained local details with the integration of global contextual information. Specifically, our method incorporates an atrous-window selective scan mechanism, enabling a gradual expansion of the scanning range with adjustable rates. This design shortens the distance between adjacent tokens, enabling the model to effectively capture fine-grained local features and global context. By leveraging the atrous window scan visual state space (AWVSS) module, we design dedicated end-to-end Mamba-based frameworks for binary change detection (BCD) and semantic change detection (SCD), referred to as AWMambaBCD and AWMambaSCD, respectively. Experimental results on six benchmark datasets show that the proposed framework outperforms existing CNN-based, Transformer-based, and Mamba-based methods.

In this paper, we propose a new Data Weighting Model (DWM) to adjust the weight of selected data within each batch to achieve a dynamic data utilization during LLM training. Specially, to better capture the dynamic data preference of the trained model, a bi-level optimization framework is implemented to update the weighting model. Our experiments demonstrate that DWM enhances the performance of models trained with randomly-selected data, and the learned weighting model can be transferred to enhance other data selection methods and models of different sizes. Moreover, we further analyze how a model's data preferences evolve throughout training, providing new insights into the data preference of the model during training."

Despite progress in hate speech detection for standard Bangla, Existing datasets and systems fail to address the informal and culturally rich expressions found in dialects such as Barishal, Noakhali, and Chittagong. This oversight results in limited detection capability and biased moderation, leaving large sections of harmful content unaccounted for. To address this gap, this study introduces BIDWESH, the first multi-dialectal Bangla hate speech dataset, constructed by translating and annotating 9,183 instances from the BD-SHS corpus into three major regional dialects. Each entry was manually verified and labeled for hate presence, type (slander, gender, religion, call to violence), and target group (individual, male, female, group), ensuring linguistic and contextual accuracy. The resulting dataset provides a linguistically rich, balanced, and inclusive resource for advancing hate speech detection in Bangla. BIDWESH lays the groundwork for the development of dialect-sensitive NLP tools and contributes significantly to equitable and context-aware content moderation in low-resource language settings."

Traditional approaches model bidding as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Recently, some studies have explored using generative reinforcement learning methods to address long-term dependency issues in bidding environments. Although effective, these methods typically rely on supervised learning approaches, which are vulnerable to low data quality due to the amount of sub-optimal bids and low probability rewards resulting from the low click and conversion rates. Unfortunately, few studies have addressed these challenges.\n  In this paper, we formalize the automated bidding as a sequence decision-making problem and propose a novel Expert-guided Bag Reward Transformer (EBaReT) to address concerns related to data quality and uncertainty rewards. Specifically, to tackle data quality issues, we generate a set of expert trajectories to serve as supplementary data in the training process and employ a Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning-based discriminator to identify expert transitions. To ensure the decision also meets the expert level, we further design a novel expert-guided inference strategy. Moreover, to mitigate the uncertainty of rewards, we consider the transitions within a certain period as a \"bag\" and carefully design a reward function that leads to a smoother acquisition of rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art bidding methods."

To alleviate this problem, we propose RSTrack, which explicitly models and supervises context reasoning via three core mechanisms. \\textit{1) Context Reasoning Mechanism}: Constructs a target state reasoning pipeline, converting unconstrained contextual associations into a temporal reasoning process that predicts the current representation based on historical target states, thereby enhancing temporal consistency. \\textit{2) Forward Supervision Strategy}: Utilizes true target features as anchors to constrain the reasoning pipeline, guiding the predicted output toward the true target distribution and suppressing drift in the context reasoning process. \\textit{3) Efficient State Modeling}: Employs a compression-reconstruction mechanism to extract the core features of the target, removing redundant information across frames and preventing ineffective contextual associations. These three mechanisms collaborate to effectively alleviate the issue of contextual association divergence in traditional temporal modeling. Experimental results show that RSTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets while maintaining real-time running speeds.

However, human ToM also contributes to dynamically planning action and strategically intervening on others' mental states. We present MindGames: a novel `planning theory of mind' (PToM) task which requires agents to infer an interlocutor's beliefs and desires to persuade them to alter their behavior. Unlike previous evaluations, we explicitly evaluate use cases of ToM. We find that humans significantly outperform o1-preview (an LLM) at our PToM task (11% higher; $p=0.006$). We hypothesize this is because humans have an implicit causal model of other agents (e.g., they know, as our task requires, to ask about people's preferences). In contrast, o1-preview outperforms humans in a baseline condition which requires a similar amount of planning but minimal mental state inferences (e.g., o1-preview is better than humans at planning when already given someone's preferences). These results suggest a significant gap between human-like social reasoning and LLM abilities."

Currently, fingerprint registration methods often consist of two steps: an initial registration based on minutiae, and a dense registration based on matching points. However, when the quality of fingerprint image is low, the number of detected minutiae is reduced, leading to frequent failures in the initial registration, which ultimately causes the entire fingerprint registration process to fail. In this study, we propose an end-to-end single-step fingerprint registration algorithm that aligns two fingerprints by directly predicting the semi-dense matching points correspondences between two fingerprints. Thus, our method minimizes the risk of minutiae registration failure and also leverages global-local attentions to achieve end-to-end pixel-level alignment between the two fingerprints. Experiment results prove that our method can achieve the state-of-the-art matching performance with only single-step registration, and it can also be used in conjunction with dense registration algorithms for further performance improvements."

To address these challenges, we introduce METER, a unified, multi-modal benchmark for interpretable forgery detection spanning images, videos, audio, and audio-visual content. Our dataset comprises four tracks, each requiring not only real-vs-fake classification but also evidence-chain-based explanations, including spatio-temporal localization, textual rationales, and forgery type tracing.

We further propose a human-aligned, three-stage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) training strategy combining SFT, DPO, and a novel GRPO stage that integrates a human-aligned evaluator with CoT reasoning.

In practice, a fixed set of demonstrations is often selected at random in many-shot settings due to (1) high inference costs, (2) the benefits of caching and reusing computations, and (3) the similar performance offered by this strategy compared to others when scaled. In this work, we propose two straightforward strategies for demonstration selection in many-shot ICL that improve performance with minimal computational overhead. Our first method combines a small number of demonstrations, selected based on their similarity to each test sample, with a disproportionately larger set of random demonstrations that are cached. The second strategy improves the first by replacing random demonstrations with those selected using centroids derived from test sample representations via k-means clustering. Our experiments with Gemini Pro and Flash across several datasets indicate that our strategies consistently outperform random selection and surpass or match the most performant selection approach while supporting caching and reducing inference cost by up to an order of magnitude. We also show that adjusting the proportion of demonstrations selected based on different criteria can balance performance and inference cost in many-shot ICL."

To overcome these limitations, this work introduces AMPTCR (Aligned Manifold Property and Topology Cloud Representation), a molecular surface representation that combines local quantum-derived scalar fields and custom topological descriptors within an aligned point cloud format. Each surface point includes a chemically meaningful scalar, geodesically derived topology vectors, and coordinates transformed into a canonical reference frame, enabling efficient learning with conventional SE(3)-sensitive architectures. AMPTCR is evaluated using a DGCNN framework on two tasks: molecular weight and bacterial growth inhibition. For molecular weight, results confirm that AMPTCR encodes physically meaningful data, with a validation R^2 of 0.87. In the bacterial inhibition task, AMPTCR enables both classification and direct regression of E. coli inhibition values using Dual Fukui functions as the electronic descriptor and Morgan Fingerprints as auxiliary data, achieving an ROC AUC of 0.912 on the classification task, and an R^2 of 0.54 on the regression task.

Existing methods mainly improve the diversity of samples through style transformation, which to some extent enhances the generalization performance of the model. However, we discover that not all styles contribute to the generalization performance. Therefore, we define styles that are beneficial or harmful to the model's generalization performance as positive or negative styles. Based on this, new issues arise: How to effectively screen and continuously utilize the positive styles. To solve these problems, we propose a Style Screening and Continuous Utilization (SSCU) framework. Firstly, we design a Generalization Gain-guided Dynamic Style Memory (GGDSM) for each client model to screen and accumulate generated positive styles. Meanwhile, we propose a style memory recognition loss to fully leverage the positive styles memorized by Memory. Furthermore, we propose a Collaborative Style Training (CST) strategy to make full use of positive styles. Unlike traditional learning strategies, our approach leverages both newly generated styles and the accumulated positive styles stored in memory to train client models on two distinct branches. This training strategy is designed to effectively promote the rapid acquisition of new styles by the client models, and guarantees the continuous and thorough utilization of positive styles, which is highly beneficial for the model's generalization performance.

However, there are few evaluation frameworks and benchmarks that systematically and automatically investigate the capabilities of these research agents. Furthermore, financial research problems have distinct complexity and subtlety. To fill in the gap, we propose FinResearchBench, which is a logic tree based Agent-as-a-Judge and targets specifically for the financial research agents. It provides a comprehensive and automatic assessment of the research agents across 7 key types of tasks in the financial research domain. The contributions of this work are two-folded: (1) the first and innovative Agent-as-a-Judge system that extracts the logic tree of the research outcome and uses it as the intermediate information to present a comprehensive, reliable and robust evaluation; (2) finance oriented that it covers 70 typical financial research questions, spreading across 7 frequently encountered types of tasks in the domain."

Due to the vast and complex mapping space, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach-but its effectiveness is often limited by sample inefficiency. We present a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework designed to overcome this challenge. By distributing the search across multiple agents, our framework accelerates exploration. To avoid inefficiencies from training multiple agents in parallel, we introduce an agent clustering algorithm that assigns similar mapping parameters to the same agents based on correlation analysis. This enables a decentralized, parallelized learning process that significantly improves sample efficiency. Experimental results show our MARL approach improves sample efficiency by 30-300x over standard single-agent RL, achieving up to 32.61x latency reduction and 16.45x energy-delay product (EDP) reduction under iso-sample conditions."

To address these, this paper introduces HoliTracer, the first framework designed to holistically extract vectorized geographic objects from large-size RSI. In HoliTracer, we enhance segmentation of large-size RSI using the Context Attention Net (CAN), which employs a local-to-global attention mechanism to capture contextual dependencies. Furthermore, we achieve holistic vectorization through a robust pipeline that leverages the Mask Contour Reformer (MCR) to reconstruct polygons and the Polygon Sequence Tracer (PST) to trace vertices.

We propose a method to enhance LLM-based tutors by representing the dialogue history with a lower-dimensional latent state representation of a student and optimizing a long-term policy to determine high-level actions based on the latent state. The goal is to better align the tutor's behavior with the long-term objective of guiding the student towards solving a target math problem on their own. Our model is lightweight, requiring less computational resources than prior work of training the tutor policy end-to-end to directly output the tutor's next utterance.

However, existing adversarial training (AT) methods for robust fine-tuning largely overlook the role of language in enhancing visual robustness. Specifically, (1) supervised AT methods rely on short texts (e.g., class labels) to generate adversarial perturbations, leading to overfitting to object classes in the training data, and (2) unsupervised AT avoids this overfitting but remains suboptimal against practical text-guided adversarial attacks due to its lack of semantic guidance. To address these limitations, we propose Quality Text-guided Adversarial Fine-Tuning (QT-AFT), which leverages high-quality captions during training to guide adversarial examples away from diverse semantics present in images. This enables the visual encoder to robustly recognize a broader range of image features even under adversarial noise, thereby enhancing robustness across diverse downstream tasks. QT-AFT overcomes the key weaknesses of prior methods -- overfitting in supervised AT and lack of semantic awareness in unsupervised AT -- achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot adversarial robustness and clean accuracy, evaluated across 16 zero-shot datasets. Furthermore, our comprehensive study uncovers several key insights into the role of language in enhancing vision robustness; for example, describing object properties in addition to object names further enhances zero-shot robustness.

Token reduction, which discards less important tokens during forward propagation, has been proposed to enhance the efficiency of transformer models. However, existing methods handle unimportant tokens irreversibly, preventing their reuse in subsequent blocks. Considering that transformers focus on different information among blocks, tokens reduced in early blocks might be useful later. Furthermore, to adapt transformer models for resource-constrained devices, it is crucial to strike a balance between model performance and computational overhead. To address these challenges, in this paper, we introduce a novel Token Freezing and Reusing (ToFe) framework, where we identify important tokens at each stage and temporarily freeze the unimportant ones, allowing their lagged reusing at a later stage. Specifically, we design a prediction module for token identification and an approximate module for recovery of the frozen tokens. By jointly optimizing with the backbone through computation budget-aware end-to-end training, ToFe can adaptively process the necessary tokens at each block, thereby reducing computational cost while maintaining performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ToFe reduces the computational cost of LV-ViT model by 50% with less than 2% drop in Top-1 accuracy, achieving a better trade-off between performance and complexity compared to state-of-the-art methods."

The offline planning leverages spatio-temporal regularities to generate a near-optimal allocation plan, while the online allocation handles complex and dynamic models such as Mixture-of-Experts (MoE).

Our experiments reveal three core findings. First, the minimum model capacity required for successful generalization scales directly with task complexity. Second, these trained networks are robust to extreme magnitude pruning (up to 95% sparsity), revealing the existence of sparse, high-performing subnetworks. Third, we show that over-parameterization provides a significant advantage in robustness against input corruption. Interpretability analysis via saliency maps further confirms that these identified sparse subnetworks preserve the core reasoning process of the original dense models.

In contrast, supervised local learning seeks to mitigate these challenges by partitioning the network into multiple local blocks and designing independent auxiliary networks to update each block separately. However, because gradients are propagated solely within individual local blocks, performance degradation occurs, preventing supervised local learning from supplanting end-to-end backpropagation. To address these limitations and facilitate inter-block information flow, we propose the Momentum Auxiliary Network++ (MAN++). MAN++ introduces a dynamic interaction mechanism by employing the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of parameters from adjacent blocks to enhance communication across the network. The auxiliary network, updated via EMA, effectively bridges the information gap between blocks. Notably, we observed that directly applying EMA parameters can be suboptimal due to feature discrepancies between local blocks. To resolve this issue, we introduce a learnable scaling bias that balances feature differences, thereby further improving performance. We validate MAN++ through extensive experiments on tasks that include image classification, object detection, and image segmentation, utilizing multiple network architectures. The experimental results demonstrate that MAN++ achieves performance comparable to end-to-end training while significantly reducing GPU memory usage. Consequently, MAN++ offers a novel perspective for supervised local learning and presents a viable alternative to conventional training methods."

However, the subtle variations in human posture, motion dynamics, and the object interactions that occur during different phases, are critical inherent knowledge of actions that cannot be fully exploited by action labels alone. In this work, we propose Language-Guided Action Anatomy (LGA), a novel framework that goes beyond label semantics by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to dissect the essential representational characteristics hidden beneath action labels. Guided by the prior knowledge encoded in LLM, LGA effectively captures rich spatiotemporal cues in few-shot scenarios. Specifically, for text, we prompt an off-the-shelf LLM to anatomize labels into sequences of atomic action descriptions, focusing on the three core elements of action (subject, motion, object). For videos, a Visual Anatomy Module segments actions into atomic video phases to capture the sequential structure of actions. A fine-grained fusion strategy then integrates textual and visual features at the atomic level, resulting in more generalizable prototypes.

Most existing methods are limited to predicting a single geometry quantity from input images. However, geometric quantities such as depth, surface normals, and point maps are inherently correlated, and estimating them in isolation often fails to ensure consistency, thereby limiting both accuracy and practical applicability. This motivates us to explore a unified framework that explicitly models the structural coupling among different geometric properties to enable joint regression. In this paper, we present Dens3R, a 3D foundation model designed for joint geometric dense prediction and adaptable to a wide range of downstream tasks. Dens3R adopts a two-stage training framework to progressively build a pointmap representation that is both generalizable and intrinsically invariant. Specifically, we design a lightweight shared encoder-decoder backbone and introduce position-interpolated rotary positional encoding to maintain expressive power while enhancing robustness to high-resolution inputs. By integrating image-pair matching features with intrinsic invariance modeling, Dens3R accurately regresses multiple geometric quantities such as surface normals and depth, achieving consistent geometry perception from single-view to multi-view inputs. Additionally, we propose a post-processing pipeline that supports geometrically consistent multi-view inference.

While recent safety-driven unlearning methods have made promising progress in suppressing model toxicity, they are identified to be fragile to downstream fine-tuning, where we reveal that state-of-the-art methods largely fail to retain their effectiveness even when fine-tuned on entirely benign datasets. To mitigate this problem, in this paper, we propose ResAlign, a safety-driven unlearning framework with enhanced resilience against downstream fine-tuning. By modeling downstream fine-tuning as an implicit optimization problem with a Moreau Envelope-based reformulation, ResAlign enables efficient gradient estimation to minimize the recovery of harmful behaviors. Additionally, a meta-learning strategy is proposed to simulate a diverse distribution of fine-tuning scenarios to improve generalization. Extensive experiments across a wide range of datasets, fine-tuning methods, and configurations demonstrate that ResAlign consistently outperforms prior unlearning approaches in retaining safety after downstream fine-tuning while preserving benign generation capability well."

Despite these advances, challenges such as long-term stability, environmental sustainability, and scalable manufacturing continue to hinder their commercialization. Precursor additive engineering has shown promise in addressing these issues by enhancing both the performance and durability of PSCs. However, the explosive growth of scientific literature and the complex interplay of materials, processes, and device architectures make it increasingly difficult for researchers to efficiently access, organize, and utilize domain knowledge in this rapidly evolving field. To address this gap, we introduce Perovskite-R1, a specialized large language model (LLM) with advanced reasoning capabilities tailored for the discovery and design of PSC precursor additives. By systematically mining and curating 1,232 high-quality scientific publications and integrating a comprehensive library of 33,269 candidate materials, we constructed a domain-specific instruction-tuning dataset using automated question-answer generation and chain-of-thought reasoning. Fine-tuning the QwQ-32B model on this dataset resulted in Perovskite-R1, which can intelligently synthesize literature insights and generate innovative and practical solutions for defect passivation and the selection of precursor additives. Experimental validation of several model-proposed strategies confirms their effectiveness in improving material stability and performance. Our work demonstrates the potential of domain-adapted LLMs in accelerating materials discovery and provides a closed-loop framework for intelligent, data-driven advancements in perovskite photovoltaic research."

Most RGBT tasks follow a case-by-case research paradigm, relying on manually customized models to learn task-oriented representations. Nevertheless, this paradigm is inherently constrained by artificial inductive bias, modality bias, and data bottleneck. To address these limitations, we make the initial attempt to build a Generalized RGBT MultiSpectral foundation model (M-SpecGene), which aims to learn modality-invariant representations from large-scale broad data in a self-supervised manner. M-SpecGene provides new insights into multispectral fusion and integrates prior case-by-case studies into a unified paradigm. Considering the unique characteristic of information imbalance in RGBT data, we introduce the Cross-Modality Structural Sparsity (CMSS) metric to quantify the information density across two modalities. Then we develop the GMM-CMSS progressive masking strategy to facilitate a flexible, easy-to-hard, and object-centric pre-training process.

We propose SpeLLM, a method that decouples input and output vocabularies by predicting character-level strings through multiple output heads. In SpeLLM, each of the $k$ linear heads predicts a single character simultaneously, enabling the model to represent a much larger output space using smaller, independent linear heads. We present a self-distillation approach for converting a standard LLM to a SpeLLM. Our experiments with four pre-trained LLMs show their SpeLLM variants achieve competitive performance on downstream tasks while reducing runtime by 5.1% on average across models. Our approach provides a potential avenue for reducing LLM costs, while increasing support for underrepresented languages and domains."

We introduce a novel, custom-built dataset captured under controlled conditions and evaluate two OCR pipelines: EAST with CRNN, and EAST with PyTesseract.

Notably, image upscaling emerged as a key pre-processing technique, reducing Character Error Rate (CER) from 0.65 to 0.48. We further demonstrate the potential of integrating eye-gaze tracking to optimise processing efficiency by focusing on user attention zones.

In fact, the prevalent large proprietary models could hardly generate verifiable programs. A promising yet largely uncharted alternative is formal language-based reasoning. Grounding LLMs in rigorous formal systems where generative models operate in formal language spaces (e.g., Dafny) enables the automatic and mathematically provable verification of their reasoning processes and outcomes. This capability is pivotal for achieving large-scale, reliable formal software verification. It is a common practice to employ human-annotated chain-of-thought and other human priors to induce the reasoning and coding capabilities of LLMs. Unfortunately, it becomes unacceptably all-consuming to provide such priors for supervising complex programming tasks. In this work, we systematically explore ways to reduce human priors with the formal language, Dafny, as the main environment for our pilot study. Our pipeline mainly relies on introducing an automatic and scalable data curation pipeline, and careful RL designs integrated with feedback from the formal language verifier. We introduce DafnyComp, a benchmark of compositional formal programs with auto-formalized specifications for specification reasoning. Our supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage enables even small models (e.g., 0.5B) to generate syntactically valid and verifiable Dafny code, surpassing proprietary models. RL with regularization further improves performance, achieving stronger generalization to out-of-domain tasks and outperforming all strong baselines on the challenging DafnyComp benchmark."

Additionally, reliance on large-scale annotations is a major bottleneck due to the time-consuming and error-prone nature of polyp boundary labeling. Recently, vision foundation models like Segment Anything Model (SAM) have demonstrated strong generalizability and fine-grained boundary detection with sparse prompts, effectively addressing key polyp segmentation challenges. However, SAM's prompt-dependent nature limits automation in medical applications, since manually inputting prompts for each image is labor-intensive and time-consuming. We propose OP-SAM, a One-shot Polyp segmentation framework based on SAM that automatically generates prompts from a single annotated image, ensuring accurate and generalizable segmentation without additional annotation burdens. Our method introduces Correlation-based Prior Generation (CPG) for semantic label transfer and Scale-cascaded Prior Fusion (SPF) to adapt to polyp size variations as well as filter out noisy transfers. Instead of dumping all prompts at once, we devise Euclidean Prompt Evolution (EPE) for iterative prompt refinement, progressively enhancing segmentation quality. Extensive evaluations across five datasets validate OP-SAM's effectiveness. Notably, on Kvasir, it achieves 76.93% IoU, surpassing the state-of-the-art by 11.44%."

Although existing methods based on either implicit or explicit keypoints have shown promise, they struggle with large pose variations due to warping artifacts or the limitations of coarse facial landmarks. In this paper, we present the Face Reenactment Video Diffusion model (FRVD), a novel framework for high-fidelity face reenactment under large pose changes. Our method first employs a motion extractor to extract implicit facial keypoints from the source and driving images to represent fine-grained motion and to perform motion alignment through a warping module. To address the degradation introduced by warping, we introduce a Warping Feature Mapper (WFM) that maps the warped source image into the motion-aware latent space of a pretrained image-to-video (I2V) model. This latent space encodes rich priors of facial dynamics learned from large-scale video data, enabling effective warping correction and enhancing temporal coherence. Extensive experiments show that FRVD achieves superior performance over existing methods in terms of pose accuracy, identity preservation, and visual quality, especially in challenging scenarios with extreme pose variations."

Furthermore, methods need to be computationally efficient in order to be deployed in real-world online settings. To address these challenges, we propose Mamba-OTR, a model based on the Mamba architecture. Mamba-OTR is designed to exploit temporal recurrence during inference while being trained on short video clips. To address label imbalance, our training pipeline incorporates the focal loss and a novel regularization scheme that aligns model predictions with the evaluation metric. Extensive experiments on EPIC-KITCHENS-100, the comparisons with transformer-based approach, and the evaluation of different training and test schemes demonstrate the superiority of Mamba-OTR in both accuracy and efficiency. These finding are particularly evident when evaluating full-length videos or high frame-rate sequences, even when trained on short video snippets for computational convenience. The proposed Mamba-OTR achieves a noteworthy mp-mAP of 45.48 when operating in a sliding-window fashion, and 43.35 in streaming mode, versus the 20.32 of a vanilla transformer and 25.16 of a vanilla Mamba, thus providing a strong baseline for OTR.

Existing models for heterophilic graphs primarily rely on pairwise relationships, overlooking multi-scale information from higher-order structures. This leads to suboptimal performance, particularly under noise from conflicting class information across nodes. To address these challenges, we propose HPGNN, a novel model integrating Higher-order Personalized PageRank with Graph Neural Networks. HPGNN introduces an efficient high-order approximation of Personalized PageRank (PPR) to capture long-range and multi-scale node interactions. This approach reduces computational complexity and mitigates noise from surrounding information.

In this study, we propose a bipartite patient-modality graph learning with event-conditional modelling of censoring for cancer survival prediction (CenSurv).

These attacks are mostly easy to create and, by executing them against the system's capture device, the malicious actor can impersonate an authorised subject and thus gain access to the latter's information (e.g., financial transactions). To protect facial recognition schemes against presentation attacks, state-of-the-art deep learning presentation attack detection (PAD) approaches require a large amount of data to produce reliable detection performances and even then, they decrease their performance for unknown presentation attack instruments (PAI) or database (information not seen during training), i.e. they lack generalisability. To mitigate the above problems, this paper focuses on zero-shot PAD. To do so, we first assess the effectiveness and generalisability of foundation models in established and challenging experimental scenarios and then propose a simple but effective framework for zero-shot PAD. Experimental results show that these models are able to achieve performance in difficult scenarios with minimal effort of the more advanced PAD mechanisms, whose weights were optimised mainly with training sets that included APs and bona fide presentations. The top-performing foundation model outperforms by a margin the best from the state of the art observed with the leaving-one-out protocol on the SiW-Mv2 database, which contains challenging unknown 2D and 3D attacks"

In this paper, we propose a Knowledge-aware Diffusion-Enhanced architecture using contrastive learning paradigms (KDiffE) for multimedia recommendations. Specifically, we first utilize original user-item graphs to build an attention-aware matrix into graph neural networks, which can learn the importance between users and items for main view construction. The attention-aware matrix is constructed by adopting a random walk with a restart strategy, which can preserve the importance between users and items to generate aggregation of attention-aware node features. Then, we propose a guided diffusion model to generate strongly task-relevant knowledge graphs with less noise for constructing a knowledge-aware contrastive view, which utilizes user embeddings with an edge connected to an item to guide the generation of strongly task-relevant knowledge graphs for enhancing the item's semantic information. We perform comprehensive experiments on three multimedia datasets that reveal the effectiveness of our KDiffE and its components on various state-of-the-art methods.

On the other hand, existing document-specific methods lack sufficient robustness against various degradations, which limits their practical deployment. This paper presents ADCD-Net, a robust document forgery localization model that adaptively leverages the RGB/DCT forensic traces and integrates key characteristics of document images. Specifically, to address the DCT traces' sensitivity to block misalignment, we adaptively modulate the DCT feature contribution based on a predicted alignment score, resulting in much improved resilience to various distortions, including resizing and cropping. Also, a hierarchical content disentanglement approach is proposed to boost the localization performance via mitigating the text-BG disparities. Furthermore, noticing the predominantly pristine nature of BG regions, we construct a pristine prototype capturing traces of untampered regions, and eventually enhance both the localization accuracy and robustness. Our proposed ADCD-Net demonstrates superior forgery localization performance, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 20.79\\% averaged over 5 types of distortions.

In our work, we evaluate gender bias in German Large Language Models (LLMs) using the Bias Benchmark for Question Answering by Parrish et al. (2022) as a reference. Specifically, the templates in the gender identity subset of this English dataset were machine translated into German. The errors in the machine translated templates were then manually reviewed and corrected with the help of a language expert. We find that manual revision of the translation is crucial when creating datasets for gender bias evaluation because of the limitations of machine translation from English to a language such as German with grammatical gender. Our final dataset is comprised of two subsets: Subset-I, which consists of group terms related to gender identity, and Subset-II, where group terms are replaced with proper names. We evaluate several LLMs used for German NLP on this newly created dataset and report the accuracy and bias scores. The results show that all models exhibit bias, both along and against existing social stereotypes."

These algorithms tend to favor the majority class, leading to biased models that struggle to accurately represent minority classes. Synthetic data holds promise for addressing the under-representation of minority classes by providing new, diverse, and highly realistic samples. This paper presents a benchmark study on the use of AI-generated synthetic data for upsampling highly unbalanced tabular data sets.\n  We evaluate the effectiveness of an open-source solution, the Synthetic Data SDK by MOSTLY AI, which provides a flexible and user-friendly approach to synthetic upsampling for mixed-type data. We compare predictive models trained on data sets upsampled with synthetic records to those using standard methods, such as naive oversampling and SMOTE-NC. Our results demonstrate that synthetic data can improve predictive accuracy for minority groups by generating diverse data points that fill gaps in sparse regions of the feature space.

Typically, AL methods rely on the empirical distribution of labeled data to define the decision boundary and perform uncertainty or diversity estimation, subsequently identifying potential high-quality samples. In few-shot scenarios, the empirical distribution often diverges significantly from the target distribution, causing the decision boundary to shift away from its optimal position. However, existing methods overlook the role of unlabeled samples in enhancing the empirical distribution to better align with the target distribution, resulting in a suboptimal decision boundary and the selection of samples that inadequately represent the target distribution. To address this, we propose a hybrid AL framework, termed \\textbf{PromptAL} (Sample-Aware Dynamic Soft \\textbf{Prompts} for Few-Shot \\textbf{A}ctive \\textbf{L}earning). This framework accounts for the contribution of each unlabeled data point in aligning the current empirical distribution with the target distribution, thereby optimizing the decision boundary. Specifically, PromptAL first leverages unlabeled data to construct sample-aware dynamic soft prompts that adjust the model's predictive distribution and decision boundary. Subsequently, based on the adjusted decision boundary, it integrates uncertainty estimation with both global and local diversity to select high-quality samples that more accurately represent the target distribution. Experimental results on six in-domain and three out-of-domain datasets show that PromptAL achieves superior performance over nine baselines. Our codebase is openly accessible."

However, its benefits vanish when applied with a diverse range of image transformations as in the state-of-the-art TrivialAugment method, and excessive label smoothing harms robustness to common corruptions.

Semi-supervised medical image segmentation aims to leverage limited annotated data alongside abundant unlabeled data to achieve accurate segmentation. However, existing semi-supervised methods often struggle to structure semantic distributions in the latent space due to noise introduced by pseudo-labels. In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion-based framework for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Our method introduces a constraint into the latent structure of semantic labels during the denoising diffusion process by enforcing prototype-based contrastive consistency. Rather than explicitly delineating semantic boundaries, the model leverages class prototypes centralized semantic representations in the latent space as anchors. This strategy improves the robustness of dense predictions, particularly in the presence of noisy pseudo-labels. We also introduce a new publicly available benchmark: Multi-Object Segmentation in X-ray Angiography Videos (MOSXAV), which provides detailed, manually annotated segmentation ground truth for multiple anatomical structures in X-ray angiography videos. Extensive experiments on the EndoScapes2023 and MOSXAV datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art medical image segmentation approaches under the semi-supervised learning setting.

Given the fast-growing popularity and wide application of these models, it is necessary to ensure safe and fair language models. As of recent considerable attention has been paid to measuring bias in language models, yet the majority of studies have focused only on English language. A Dutch version of the US-specific CrowS-Pairs dataset for measuring bias in Dutch language models is introduced. The resulting dataset consists of 1463 sentence pairs that cover bias in 9 categories, such as Sexual orientation, Gender and Disability. The sentence pairs are composed of contrasting sentences, where one of the sentences concerns disadvantaged groups and the other advantaged groups. Using the Dutch CrowS-Pairs dataset, we show that various language models, BERTje, RobBERT, multilingual BERT, GEITje and Mistral-7B exhibit substantial bias across the various bias categories. Using the English and French versions of the CrowS-Pairs dataset, bias was evaluated in English (BERT and RoBERTa) and French (FlauBERT and CamemBERT) language models, and it was shown that English models exhibit the most bias, whereas Dutch models the least amount of bias. Additionally, results also indicate that assigning a persona to a language model changes the level of bias it exhibits. These findings highlight the variability of bias across languages and contexts, suggesting that cultural and linguistic factors play a significant role in shaping model biases."

These systems often rely on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to learn and encode meaning directly from data, enabling more efficient communication. However, in multi-user settings where interacting agents are trained independently-without shared context or joint optimization-divergent latent representations across AI-native devices can lead to semantic mismatches, impeding mutual understanding even in the absence of traditional transmission errors. In this work, we address semantic mismatch in Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) channels by proposing a joint physical and semantic channel equalization framework that leverages the presence of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS). The semantic equalization is implemented as a sequence of transformations: (i) a pre-equalization stage at the transmitter; (ii) propagation through the RIS-aided channel; and (iii) a post-equalization stage at the receiver. We formulate the problem as a constrained Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE) optimization and propose two solutions: (i) a linear semantic equalization chain, and (ii) a non-linear DNN-based semantic equalizer. Both methods are designed to operate under semantic compression in the latent space and adhere to transmit power constraints. Through extensive evaluations, we show that the proposed joint equalization strategies consistently outperform conventional, disjoint approaches to physical and semantic channel equalization across a broad range of scenarios and wireless channel conditions."

Single-image shadow removal (SR), particularly under challenging indirect illumination, is hampered by non-uniform content degradation and inherent ambiguity. Consequently, traditional methods often fail to simultaneously recover intra-shadow details and maintain sharp boundaries, resulting in inconsistent restoration and blurring that negatively affect both downstream applications and the overall viewing experience. To overcome these limitations, we propose the DenseSR, approaching the problem from a dense prediction perspective to emphasize restoration quality. This framework uniquely synergizes two key strategies: (1) deep scene understanding guided by geometric-semantic priors to resolve ambiguity and implicitly localize shadows, and (2) high-fidelity restoration via a novel Dense Fusion Block (DFB) in the decoder. The DFB employs adaptive component processing-using an Adaptive Content Smoothing Module (ACSM) for consistent appearance and a Texture-Boundary Recuperation Module (TBRM) for fine textures and sharp boundaries-thereby directly tackling the inconsistent restoration and blurring issues. These purposefully processed components are effectively fused, yielding an optimized feature representation preserving both consistency and fidelity.

To address this limitation, we shift the focus to the hidden state update process and introduce a novel metric, the ICR Score (Information Contribution to Residual Stream), which quantifies the contribution of modules to the hidden states' update. We empirically validate that the ICR Score is effective and reliable in distinguishing hallucinations. Building on these insights, we propose a hallucination detection method, the ICR Probe, which captures the cross-layer evolution of hidden states. Experimental results show that the ICR Probe achieves superior performance with significantly fewer parameters. Furthermore, ablation studies and case analyses offer deeper insights into the underlying mechanism of this method, improving its interpretability."

Recent HTC approaches use various techniques to incorporate the hierarchical class structure information with the natural language understanding capabilities of pre-trained language models (PLMs) to improve classification performance. Furthermore, using topic models along with PLMs to extract features from text documents has been shown to be an effective approach for multi-label text classification tasks. The rationale behind the combination of these feature extractor models is that the PLM captures the finer-grained contextual and semantic information while the topic model obtains high-level representations which consider the corpus of documents as a whole. In this paper, we use a HTC approach which uses a PLM and a topic model to extract features from text documents which are used to train a classification model. Our objective is to determine whether the combination of the features extracted from the two models is beneficial to HTC performance in general. In our approach, the extracted features are passed through separate convolutional layers whose outputs are combined and passed to a label-wise attention mechanisms which obtains label-specific document representations by weighing the most important features for each class separately. We perform comprehensive experiments on three HTC benchmark datasets and show that using the features extracted from the topic model generally decreases classification performance compared to only using the features obtained by the PLM. In contrast to previous work, this shows that the incorporation of features extracted from topic models for text classification tasks should not be assumed beneficial."

However, validating whether discovered clusters represent distinct relationships rather than arbitrary groupings remains a fundamental challenge. Existing clustering validity indices were developed for Euclidean data, and their effectiveness for correlation patterns has not been systematically evaluated. Unlike Euclidean clustering, where geometric shapes provide discrete reference targets, correlations exist in continuous space without equivalent reference patterns. We address this validation gap by introducing canonical correlation patterns as mathematically defined validation targets that discretise the infinite correlation space into finite, interpretable reference patterns. Using synthetic datasets with perfect ground truth across controlled conditions, we demonstrate that canonical patterns provide reliable validation targets, with L1 norm for mapping and L5 norm for silhouette width criterion and Davies-Bouldin index showing superior performance. These methods are robust to distribution shifts and appropriately detect correlation structure degradation, enabling practical implementation guidelines. This work establishes a methodological foundation for rigorous correlation-based clustering validation in high-stakes domains."

We introduce PlantSAM, an automated segmentation pipeline that integrates YOLOv10 for plant region detection and the Segment Anything Model (SAM2) for segmentation. YOLOv10 generates bounding box prompts to guide SAM2, enhancing segmentation accuracy. Both models were fine-tuned on herbarium images and evaluated using Intersection over Union (IoU) and Dice coefficient metrics. PlantSAM achieved state-of-the-art segmentation performance, with an IoU of 0.94 and a Dice coefficient of 0.97. Incorporating segmented images into classification models led to consistent performance improvements across five tested botanical traits, with accuracy gains of up to 4.36% and F1-score improvements of 4.15%.

We argue that analogy plays a central role in these processes, enabling agents to reuse solution-relevant structure from past experiences and amortise the computational costs of both model construction (construal) and planning. Formalising analogies as partial homomorphisms between Markov decision processes, we sketch a framework in which abstract modules, derived from previous construals, serve as composable building blocks for new ones.

To address these issues, we introduce the **Ever-Evolving Science Exam (EESE)**, a dynamic benchmark designed to reliably assess scientific capabilities in foundation models. Our approach consists of two components: 1) a non-public **EESE-Pool** with over 100K expertly constructed science instances (question-answer pairs) across 5 disciplines and 500+ subfields, built through a multi-stage pipeline ensuring **Range**, **Reach**, and **Rigor**, 2) a periodically updated 500-instance subset **EESE**, sampled and validated to enable leakage-resilient, low-overhead evaluations. Experiments on 32 open- and closed-source models demonstrate that EESE effectively differentiates the strengths and weaknesses of models in scientific fields and cognitive dimensions.

It also explores the interaction effects between QE and MT quality, as well as between QE and translation expertise. The findings reveal that QE significantly reduces post-editing time. The examined interaction effects were not significant, suggesting that QE consistently improves MTPE efficiency across medium- and high-quality MT outputs and among student translators with varying levels of expertise. In addition to indicating potentially problematic segments, QE serves multiple functions in MTPE, such as validating translators' evaluations of MT quality and enabling them to double-check translation outputs. However, interview data suggest that inaccurate QE may hinder post-editing processes. This research provides new insights into the strengths and limitations of QE, facilitating its more effective integration into MTPE workflows to enhance translators' productivity."

However, further enhancing existing MLLMs necessitates high-quality vision-language datasets with carefully curated task complexities, which are both costly and challenging to scale. Although recent self-improving models that iteratively refine themselves offer a feasible solution, they still suffer from two core challenges: (i) most existing methods augment visual or textual data separately, resulting in discrepancies in data complexity (e.g., over-simplified diagrams paired with redundant textual descriptions); and (ii) the evolution of data and models is also separated, leading to scenarios where models are exposed to tasks with mismatched difficulty levels. To address these issues, we propose C2-Evo, an automatic, closed-loop self-improving framework that jointly evolves both training data and model capabilities. Specifically, given a base dataset and a base model, C2-Evo enhances them by a cross-modal data evolution loop and a data-model evolution loop. The former loop expands the base dataset by generating complex multimodal problems that combine structured textual sub-problems with iteratively specified geometric diagrams, while the latter loop adaptively selects the generated problems based on the performance of the base model, to conduct supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning alternately. Consequently, our method continuously refines its model and training data, and consistently obtains considerable performance gains across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Our code, models, and datasets will be released."

To overcome these limitations, we propose Spatial 3D-LLM, a 3D MLLM specifically designed to enhance spatial awareness for 3D vision-language tasks by enriching the spatial embeddings of 3D scenes. Spatial 3D-LLM integrates an LLM backbone with a progressive spatial awareness scheme that progressively captures spatial information as the perception field expands, generating location-enriched 3D scene embeddings to serve as visual prompts. Furthermore, we introduce two novel tasks: 3D object distance measurement and 3D layout editing, and construct a 3D instruction dataset, MODEL, to evaluate the model's spatial awareness capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that Spatial 3D-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of 3D vision-language tasks, revealing the improvements stemmed from our progressive spatial awareness scheme of mining more profound spatial information.

This overreliance has led to saturation, with reported improvements often falling within the margin of noise. Second, implementations of gradient-based one-shot NAS methods are fragmented across disparate repositories, complicating fair and reproducible comparisons and further development. In this paper, we introduce Configurable Optimizer (confopt), an extensible library designed to streamline the development and evaluation of gradient-based one-shot NAS methods. Confopt provides a minimal API that makes it easy for users to integrate new search spaces, while also supporting the decomposition of NAS optimizers into their core components.

We address this through a dual innovation in data infrastructure and model architecture. First, we introduce Aerial-Earth3D, the largest 3D aerial dataset to date, consisting of 50k curated scenes (each measuring 600m x 600m) captured across the U.S. mainland, comprising 45M multi-view Google Earth frames. Each scene provides pose-annotated multi-view images, depth maps, normals, semantic segmentation, and camera poses, with explicit quality control to ensure terrain diversity. Building on this foundation, we propose EarthCrafter, a tailored framework for large-scale 3D Earth generation via sparse-decoupled latent diffusion. Our architecture separates structural and textural generation: 1) Dual sparse 3D-VAEs compress high-resolution geometric voxels and textural 2D Gaussian Splats (2DGS) into compact latent spaces, largely alleviating the costly computation suffering from vast geographic scales while preserving critical information. 2) We propose condition-aware flow matching models trained on mixed inputs (semantics, images, or neither) to flexibly model latent geometry and texture features independently. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EarthCrafter performs substantially better in extremely large-scale generation. The framework further supports versatile applications, from semantic-guided urban layout generation to unconditional terrain synthesis, while maintaining geographic plausibility through our rich data priors from Aerial-Earth3D."

Combining advanced computer algorithms, such as DNNs, with small-size snapshot HSI cameras enhances the reliability of these systems. HSI overcomes intrinsic limitations of greyscale and RGB imaging in depicting physical properties of targets, particularly regarding spectral reflectance and metamerism. Despite promising results in HSI-based vision developments, safety-critical systems like ADS demand strict constraints on latency, resource consumption, and security, motivating the shift of ML workloads to edge platforms. This involves a thorough software/hardware co-design scheme to distribute and optimize the tasks efficiently among the limited resources of computing platforms. With respect to inference, the over-parameterized nature of DNNs poses significant computational challenges for real-time on-the-edge deployment. In addition, the intensive data preprocessing required by HSI, which is frequently overlooked, must be carefully managed in terms of memory arrangement and inter-task communication to enable an efficient integrated pipeline design on a SoC. This work presents a set of optimization techniques for the practical co-design of a DNN-based HSI segmentation processor deployed on a FPGA-based SoC targeted at ADS, including key optimizations such as functional software/hardware task distribution, hardware-aware preprocessing, ML model compression, and a complete pipelined deployment. Applied compression techniques significantly reduce the complexity of the designed DNN to 24.34% of the original operations and to 1.02% of the original number of parameters, achieving a 2.86x speed-up in the inference task without noticeable degradation of the segmentation accuracy."

Finally, we introduce novel kernels over the space of probability measures on CW complexes based on the dual formulation of optimal transport."

We assess the open-source models InternVL 2.5, Qwen 2.5 VL, LLaVA-OneVision, and the proprietary Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking, finding that even the latest models struggle to reliably distinguish physically plausible from implausible scenarios. To go beyond performance metrics, we conduct a probing analysis of model embeddings, extracting intermediate representations at key processing stages to examine how well task-relevant information is preserved. Our results show that, depending on task difficulty, a critical vision-language misalignment can emerge: vision encoders successfully capture physical plausibility cues, but this information is not effectively utilized by the language model, leading to failures in reasoning. This misalignment suggests that the primary limitation of MLLMs in intuitive physics tasks is not the vision component but the ineffective integration of visual and linguistic information. Our findings highlight vision-language alignment as a key area for improvement, offering insights for future MLLMs development."

While various linear attention variants mitigate these efficiency constraints by compressing context into fixed-size states, they often degrade performance in tasks such as in-context retrieval and reasoning. To address this limitation and achieve more effective context compression, we propose two key innovations. First, we introduce a row-sparse update formulation for linear attention by conceptualizing state updating as information classification. This enables sparse state updates via softmax-based top-$k$ hard classification, thereby extending receptive fields and reducing inter-class interference. Second, we present Sparse State Expansion (SSE) within the sparse framework, which expands the contextual state into multiple partitions, effectively decoupling parameter size from state capacity while maintaining the sparse classification paradigm. Our design, supported by efficient parallelized implementations, yields effective classification and discriminative state representations. We extensively validate SSE in both pure linear and hybrid (SSE-H) architectures across language modeling, in-context retrieval, and mathematical reasoning benchmarks. SSE demonstrates strong retrieval performance and scales favorably with state size. Moreover, after reinforcement learning (RL) training, our 2B SSE-H model achieves state-of-the-art mathematical reasoning performance among small reasoning models, scoring 64.7 on AIME24 and 51.3 on AIME25, significantly outperforming similarly sized open-source Transformers. These results highlight SSE as a promising and efficient architecture for long-context modeling."

To resolve these issues, we present a multimodal deviation perceiving framework for weakly-supervised temporal forgery localization (MDP), which aims to identify temporal partial forged segments using only video-level annotations. The MDP proposes a novel multimodal interaction mechanism (MI) and an extensible deviation perceiving loss to perceive multimodal deviation, which achieves the refined start and end timestamps localization of forged segments. Specifically, MI introduces a temporal property preserving cross-modal attention to measure the relevance between the visual and audio modalities in the probabilistic embedding space. It could identify the inter-modality deviation and construct comprehensive video features for temporal forgery localization. To explore further temporal deviation for weakly-supervised learning, an extensible deviation perceiving loss has been proposed, aiming at enlarging the deviation of adjacent segments of the forged samples and reducing that of genuine samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and achieve comparable results to fully-supervised approaches in several evaluation metrics."

While dynamic cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) can capture detailed tissue motion throughout the cardiac cycle, the fine-grained 4D cardiac motion tracking remains challenging due to the homogeneous nature of myocardial tissue and the lack of distinctive features. Existing approaches can be broadly categorized into image based and representation-based, each with its limitations. Image-based methods, including both raditional and deep learning-based registration approaches, either struggle with topological consistency or rely heavily on extensive training data. Representation-based methods, while promising, often suffer from loss of image-level details. To address these limitations, we propose Dynamic 3D Gaussian Representation (Dyna3DGR), a novel framework that combines explicit 3D Gaussian representation with implicit neural motion field modeling. Our method simultaneously optimizes cardiac structure and motion in a self-supervised manner, eliminating the need for extensive training data or point-to-point correspondences. Through differentiable volumetric rendering, Dyna3DGR efficiently bridges continuous motion representation with image-space alignment while preserving both topological and temporal consistency. Comprehensive evaluations on the ACDC dataset demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art deep learning-based diffeomorphic registration methods in tracking accuracy.

We introduce a self-supervised framework, namely Codebook-based Temporal-Spatial Learning (CTSL), that learns dynamic, spatiotemporal representations from raw Cine data without requiring segmentation masks. CTSL decouples temporal and spatial features through a multi-view distillation strategy, where the teacher model processes multiple Cine views, and the student model learns from reduced-dimensional Cine-SA sequences. By leveraging codebook-based feature representations and dynamic lesion self-detection through motion cues, CTSL captures intricate temporal dependencies and motion patterns.

The end goal for this process is to alleviate radiologists' workloads and provide second opinions to clinicians or patients. Thus, a necessary prerequisite for report generation models is a strong general performance and some type of innate grounding capability, to convince clinicians or patients of the veracity of the generated reports. In this paper, we present ASaRG (\\textbf{A}utomatic \\textbf{S}egmentation-\\textbf{a}ssisted \\textbf{R}eport \\textbf{G}eneration), an extension of the popular LLaVA architecture that aims to tackle both of these problems. ASaRG proposes to fuse intermediate features and fine-grained segmentation maps created by specialist radiological models into LLaVA's multi-modal projection layer via simple concatenation. With a small number of added parameters, our approach achieves a +0.89\\% performance gain ($p=0.012$) in CE F1 score compared to the LLaVA baseline when using only intermediate features, and +2.77\\% performance gain ($p<0.001$) when adding a combination of intermediate features and fine-grained segmentation maps. Compared with COMG and ORID, two other report generation methods that utilize segmentations, the performance gain amounts to 6.98\\% and 6.28\\% in F1 score, respectively. ASaRG is not mutually exclusive with other changes made to the LLaVA architecture, potentially allowing our method to be combined with other advances in the field. Finally, the use of an arbitrary number of segmentations as part of the input demonstrably allows tracing elements of the report to the corresponding segmentation maps and verifying the groundedness of assessments.

Recent studies integrated Local Attention Transformers with Mamba to capture both local details and global contexts. Despite competitive performance, these methods are limited to simple stacking of Transformer and Mamba layers without any interaction mechanism between them. Thus, deep integration between Transformer and Mamba layers remains an open problem. We address this problem by proposing A2Mamba, a powerful Transformer-Mamba hybrid network architecture, featuring a new token mixer termed Multi-scale Attention-augmented State Space Model (MASS), where multi-scale attention maps are integrated into an attention-augmented SSM (A2SSM). A key step of A2SSM performs a variant of cross-attention by spatially aggregating the SSM's hidden states using the multi-scale attention maps, which enhances spatial dependencies pertaining to a two-dimensional space while improving the dynamic modeling capabilities of SSMs. Our A2Mamba outperforms all previous ConvNet-, Transformer-, and Mamba-based architectures in visual recognition tasks. For instance, A2Mamba-L achieves an impressive 86.1% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K. In semantic segmentation, A2Mamba-B exceeds CAFormer-S36 by 2.5% in mIoU, while exhibiting higher efficiency.

While monitoring tasks have traditionally been carried out manually, advances in machine learning have made it possible to collect individualized information in an increasingly automated way. Central to these methods is the localization of animals across space (object detection) and time (multi-object tracking). Despite extensive research of these two tasks in pig farming, a systematic benchmarking study has not yet been conducted. In this work, we address this gap by curating two datasets: PigDetect for object detection and PigTrack for multi-object tracking. The datasets are based on diverse image and video material from realistic barn conditions, and include challenging scenarios such as occlusions or bad visibility. For object detection, we show that challenging training images improve detection performance beyond what is achievable with randomly sampled images alone. Comparing different approaches, we found that state-of-the-art models offer substantial improvements in detection quality over real-time alternatives. For multi-object tracking, we observed that SORT-based methods achieve superior detection performance compared to end-to-end trainable models. However, end-to-end models show better association performance, suggesting they could become strong alternatives in the future. We also investigate characteristic failure cases of end-to-end models, providing guidance for future improvements. The detection and tracking models trained on our datasets perform well in unseen pens, suggesting good generalization capabilities. This highlights the importance of high-quality training data.

However, the amount of time-consuming annotated data for capturing worldwide diversity may never catch up with the demands of increasingly data-hungry models. Thus, we propose a novel approach: re-training models at test time using synthetic data tailored to the target region's city layout. This method generates geo-typical synthetic data that closely replicates the urban structure of a target area by leveraging geospatial data such as street network from OpenStreetMap. Using procedural modeling and physics-based rendering, very high-resolution synthetic images are created, incorporating domain randomization in building shapes, materials, and environmental illumination. This enables the generation of virtually unlimited training samples that maintain the essential characteristics of the target environment. To overcome synthetic-to-real domain gaps, our approach integrates geo-typical data into an adversarial domain adaptation framework for building segmentation. Experiments demonstrate significant performance enhancements, with median improvements of up to 12%, depending on the domain gap. This scalable and cost-effective method blends partial geographic knowledge with synthetic imagery, providing a promising solution to the \"model collapse\" issue in purely synthetic datasets. It offers a practical pathway to improving generalization in remote sensing building segmentation without extensive real-world annotations."

We define a Nonunified score that quantifies such self-contradiction. Our empirical results reveal that the self-contradiction mainly arises from weak generation that fails to align with prompts, rather than misunderstanding. This capability asymmetry indicates the potential of leveraging self-contradiction for self-improvement, where the stronger model understanding guides the weaker generation to mitigate the generation-understanding gap. Applying standard post-training methods (e.g., SFT, DPO) with such internal supervision successfully improves both generation and unification. We discover a co-improvement effect on both generation and understanding when only fine-tuning the generation branch, a phenomenon known in pre-training but underexplored in post-training. Our analysis shows improvements stem from better detection of false positives that are previously incorrectly identified as prompt-aligned. Theoretically, we show the aligned training dynamics between generation and understanding allow reduced prompt-misaligned generations to also improve mismatch detection in the understanding branch. Additionally, the framework reveals a potential risk of co-degradation under poor supervision-an overlooked phenomenon that is empirically validated in our experiments. Notably, we find intrinsic metrics like Nonunified score cannot distinguish co-degradation from co-improvement, which highlights the necessity of data quality check. Finally, we propose a curriculum-based strategy based on our findings that gradually introduces harder samples as the model improves, leading to better unification and improved MLLM generation and understanding."

The current solutions i.e. supervised fine-tuning and collaborative filtering are dense-user-item focused and would be expensive to maintain and update. This paper introduces a meta-learning framework, that can be used to perform parameter-efficient prompt-tuning, to effectively personalize LLM-based recommender systems quickly at cold-start. The model learns soft prompt embeddings with first-order (Reptile) and second-order (MAML) optimization by treating each of the users as the tasks. As augmentations to the input tokens, these learnable vectors are the differentiable control variables that represent user behavioral priors. The prompts are meta-optimized through episodic sampling, inner-loop adaptation, and outer-loop generalization. On MovieLens-1M, Amazon Reviews, and Recbole, we can see that our adaptive model outperforms strong baselines in NDCG@10, HR@10, and MRR, and it runs in real-time (i.e., below 300 ms) on consumer GPUs. Zero-history personalization is also supported by this scalable solution, and its 275 ms rate of adaptation allows successful real-time risk profiling of financial systems by shortening detection latency and improving payment network stability. Crucially, the 275 ms adaptation capability can enable real-time risk profiling for financial institutions, reducing systemic vulnerability detection latency significantly versus traditional compliance checks. By preventing contagion in payment networks (e.g., Fedwire), the framework strengthens national financial infrastructure resilience."

        "summary": "arXiv:2507.16674v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In recent years, Transformer architectures have revolutionized most fields of artificial intelligence, relying on an attentional mechanism based on the agreement between keys and queries to select and route information in the network. In previous work, we introduced a novel, brain-inspired architecture that leverages a similar implementation to achieve a global 'routing by agreement' mechanism. Such a system modulates the network's activity by matching each neuron's key with a single global query, pooled across the entire network. Acting as a global attentional system, this mechanism improves noise robustness over baseline levels but is insufficient for multi-classification tasks. Here, we improve on this work by proposing a novel mechanism that combines aspects of the Transformer attentional operations with a compelling neuroscience theory, namely, binding by synchrony. This theory proposes that the brain binds together features by synchronizing the temporal activity of neurons encoding those features. This allows the binding of features from the same object while efficiently disentangling those from distinct objects. We drew inspiration from this theory and incorporated angular phases into all layers of a convolutional network. After achieving phase alignment via Kuramoto dynamics, we use this approach to enhance operations between neurons with similar phases and suppresses those with opposite phases. We test the benefits of this mechanism on two datasets: one composed of pairs of digits and one composed of a combination of an MNIST item superimposed on a CIFAR-10 image. Our results reveal better accuracy than CNN networks, proving more robust to noise and with better generalization abilities. Overall, we propose a novel mechanism that addresses the visual binding problem in neural networks by leveraging the synergy between neuroscience and machine learning."

A major challenge in these accelerators is efficiently detecting errors caused by random hardware faults. Traditional algorithm-based fault tolerance (ABFT) techniques verify individual matrix multiplications but fall short in handling the full attention mechanism, particularly due to intermediate softmax normalization. This work proposes Flash-ABFT, a novel method that computes an online checksum across the entire three-matrix product of query, key and value matrices, of an attention layer, including the softmax operation, with a single check. This approach significantly reduces overhead by eliminating redundant checks while maintaining high fault-detection accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that Flash-ABFT incurs only 5.3% hardware area overhead and less than 1.9% energy overhead, making it a cost-effective and robust solution for error detection in attention accelerators."

However, LLMs' comprehension of input prompts remains agnostic, limiting ICA's ability to address value tensions--human values are inherently pluralistic, often imposing conflicting demands, e.g., stimulation vs. tradition. Current ICA methods therefore face the Instruction Bottleneck challenge, where LLMs struggle to reconcile multiple intended values within a single prompt, leading to incomplete or biased alignment. To address this, we propose PICACO, a novel pluralistic ICA method. Without fine-tuning, PICACO optimizes a meta-instruction that navigates multiple values to better elicit LLMs' understanding of them and improve their alignment. This is achieved by maximizing the total correlation between specified values and LLM responses, theoretically reinforcing value correlation while reducing distractive noise, resulting in effective value instructions. Extensive experiments on five value sets show that PICACO works well with both black-box and open-source LLMs, outperforms several recent strong baselines, and achieves a better balance across up to 8 distinct values."

However, when devices rely on different languages, logic, or internal representations, semantic mismatches may occur, potentially hindering mutual understanding. This paper introduces a novel approach to addressing latent space misalignment in semantic communications, exploiting multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications. Specifically, our method learns a MIMO precoder/decoder pair that jointly performs latent space compression and semantic channel equalization, mitigating both semantic mismatches and physical channel impairments. We explore two solutions: (i) a linear model, optimized by solving a biconvex optimization problem via the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM); (ii) a neural network-based model, which learns semantic MIMO precoder/decoder under transmission power budget and complexity constraints. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in a goal-oriented semantic communication scenario, illustrating the main trade-offs between accuracy, communication burden, and complexity of the solutions."

Retinex theory addresses this by viewing an image S as the pixel-wise product of reflectance R and illumination I, mirroring the way people perceive stable object colors under changing light. The decomposition is ill-posed, and classic Retinex models have four key flaws: (i) they treat the red, green, and blue channels independently; (ii) they lack a neuroscientific model of color vision; (iii) they cannot perfectly rebuild the input image; and (iv) they do not explain human color constancy. We introduce the first Quaternion Retinex formulation, in which the scene is written as the Hamilton product of quaternion-valued reflectance and illumination. To gauge how well reflectance stays invariant, we propose the Reflectance Consistency Index. Tests on low-light crack inspection, face detection under varied lighting, and infrared-visible fusion show gains of 2-11 percent over leading methods, with better color fidelity, lower noise, and higher reflectance stability."

However, we argue that the M5 signals can be modeled in a unified manner due to the intrinsic similarity. As a result, we propose FISHER, a Foundation model for multi-modal Industrial Signal compreHEnsive Representation. To support arbitrary sampling rates, FISHER considers the increment of sampling rate as the concatenation of sub-band information. Specifically, FISHER takes the STFT sub-band as the modeling unit and adopts a teacher student SSL framework for pre-training. We also develop the RMIS benchmark, which evaluates the representations of M5 industrial signals on multiple health management tasks. Compared with top SSL models, FISHER showcases versatile and outstanding capabilities with a general performance gain up to 5.03%, along with much more efficient scaling curves. We also investigate the scaling law on downstream tasks and derive potential avenues for future works. FISHER is now open-sourced on https://github.com/jianganbai/FISHER"

While recent work on structured screen representation has primarily addressed specific challenges, such as UI element detection or captioning, none has attempted to capture the full complexity of desktop interfaces by replicating their entire hierarchical structure. To bridge this gap, we introduce Screen2AX, the first framework to automatically create real-time, tree-structured accessibility metadata from a single screenshot. Our method uses vision-language and object detection models to detect, describe, and organize UI elements hierarchically, mirroring macOS's system-level accessibility structure. To tackle the limited availability of data for macOS desktop applications, we compiled and publicly released three datasets encompassing 112 macOS applications, each annotated for UI element detection, grouping, and hierarchical accessibility metadata alongside corresponding screenshots. Screen2AX accurately infers hierarchy trees, achieving a 77% F1 score in reconstructing a complete accessibility tree. Crucially, these hierarchy trees improve the ability of autonomous agents to interpret and interact with complex desktop interfaces. We introduce Screen2AX-Task, a benchmark specifically designed for evaluating autonomous agent task execution in macOS desktop environments. Using this benchmark, we demonstrate that Screen2AX delivers a 2.2x performance improvement over native accessibility representations and surpasses the state-of-the-art OmniParser V2 system on the ScreenSpot benchmark."

A key challenge lies in the scarcity of high-quality, large-scale, image-text paired training data. Recently, several works introduced extensive image-text datasets for RS and trained their VLFMs. However, due to the rudimentary methods used for generating captions, the quality of datasets is suboptimal, requiring larger volumes of training data, while only yielding modest performance improvements. In this paper, we propose a two-stage method named MpGI(Multi-Perspective Generation and Integration) for generating high-quality text captions for RS images. Firstly, we generate distinct and detailed descriptions from different perspectives using Rule-MLLM(Multimodal Large Language Model) Relay Generation and MLLMs generation methods. Next, we utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to integrate these diverse descriptions into comprehensive captions, capturing details from multiple perspectives. Finally, we have created the HQRS-IT-210K dataset, including about 210,000 RS images and 1.3 million captions. We fine-tuned two VLFMs using our dataset: CLIP, a discriminative model, and CoCa, an image-to-text generative model. This process resulted in our proposed HQRS-CLIP and RS-CoCa models. Experimental results demonstrate that HQRS-CLIP surpassed the previous SOTA RS CLIP model in various downstream tasks while using only 4.2\\% of the training data. RS-CoCa outperforms other advanced approaches across benchmark datasets and can generate captions for RS images that rival or even exceed manual annotations. Dataset, pre-trained models, and codes will be released at https://github.com/YiguoHe/HQRS-210K-and-HQRS-CLIP."

This shortcoming limits the utility for video segmentation in complex and variable scenarios, where a closed set of object categories is difficult to define and where users may not know the exact object category that will appear in the video. Such scenarios can arise in operating room video analysis, where different health systems may use different workflows and instrumentation, requiring flexible solutions for video analysis. Reasoning segmentation (RS) now offers promise towards such a solution, enabling natural language text queries as interaction for identifying object to segment. However, existing video RS formulation assume that target objects remain contextually relevant throughout entire video sequences. This assumption is inadequate for real-world scenarios in which objects of interest appear, disappear or change relevance dynamically based on temporal context, such as surgical instruments that become relevant only during specific procedural phases or anatomical structures that gain importance at particular moments during surgery. Our first contribution is the introduction of temporally-constrained video reasoning segmentation, a novel task formulation that requires models to implicitly infer when target objects become contextually relevant based on text queries that incorporate temporal reasoning. Since manual annotation of temporally-constrained video RS datasets would be expensive and limit scalability, our second contribution is an innovative automated benchmark construction method. Finally, we present TCVideoRSBenchmark, a temporally-constrained video RS dataset containing 52 samples using the videos from the MVOR dataset."

First, the complex queries commonly used in current benchmarks often deviate from realistic user search scenarios. Second, prior approaches tend to introduce noise when extracting ground truth for end-to-end evaluations, leading to distorted assessments at a fine-grained level. Third, most current frameworks focus solely on the quality of final answers, neglecting the evaluation of the iterative process inherent to agentic search.

Moreover, RAVine examines model's interaction with search tools throughout the iterative process, and accounts for factors of efficiency.

The interaction mechanism between such signals remains unclear but pivotal for their disambiguation. In this paper we investigate the relationship between DM polysemy and co-occurrence of non-DM signals in English, as well as the influence of genre on these patterns.\n  Using the framework of eRST, we propose a graded definition of DM polysemy, and conduct correlation and regression analyses to examine whether polysemous DMs are accompanied by more numerous and diverse non-DM signals. Our findings reveal that while polysemous DMs do co-occur with more diverse non-DMs, the total number of co-occurring signals does not necessarily increase. Moreover, genre plays a significant role in shaping DM-signal interactions."

However, adapting SAM to CD-FSS faces two critical challenges: reliance on manual prompt and limited cross-domain ability. Therefore, we propose the Composable Meta-Prompt (CMP) framework that introduces three key modules: (i) the Reference Complement and Transformation (RCT) module for semantic expansion, (ii) the Composable Meta-Prompt Generation (CMPG) module for automated meta-prompt synthesis, and (iii) the Frequency-Aware Interaction (FAI) module for domain discrepancy mitigation.

B-cos networks offer a promising solution by replacing standard linear layers with a weight-input alignment mechanism, producing inherently interpretable, class-specific explanations without post-hoc methods. While maintaining diagnostic performance competitive with state-of-the-art DNNs, standard B-cos models suffer from severe aliasing artifacts in their explanation maps, making them unsuitable for clinical use where clarity is essential. Additionally, the original B-cos formulation is limited to multi-class settings, whereas chest X-ray analysis often requires multi-label classification due to co-occurring abnormalities. In this work, we address both limitations: (1) we introduce anti-aliasing strategies using FLCPooling (FLC) and BlurPool (BP) to significantly improve explanation quality, and (2) we extend B-cos networks to support multi-label classification.

For these machines, far more computation will be possible than that which can be saved to disk. As a result, users will be unable to rely on post-hoc access to data for uncertainty quantification and other statistical analyses and there will be an urgent need for sophisticated machine learning algorithms which can be trained in situ. Algorithms deployed in this setting must be highly scalable, memory efficient and capable of handling data which is distributed across nodes as spatially contiguous partitions. One suitable approach involves fitting a sparse variational Gaussian process (SVGP) model independently and in parallel to each spatial partition. The resulting model is scalable, efficient and generally accurate, but produces the undesirable effect of constructing discontinuous response surfaces due to the disagreement between neighboring models at their shared boundary. In this paper, we extend this idea by allowing for a small amount of communication between neighboring spatial partitions which encourages better alignment of the local models, leading to smoother spatial predictions and a better fit in general. Due to our decentralized communication scheme, the proposed extension remains highly scalable and adds very little overhead in terms of computation (and none, in terms of memory). We demonstrate this Partitioned SVGP (PSVGP) approach for the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) and compare the results to the independent SVGP case."

Traditional quantization methods rely on access to original training data, which is often restricted due to privacy concerns or security challenges. Zero-shot Quantization (ZSQ) addresses this by using synthetic data generated from pre-trained models, eliminating the need for real training data. Recently, ZSQ has been extended to object detection. However, existing methods use unlabeled task-agnostic synthetic images that lack the specific information required for object detection, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a novel task-specific ZSQ framework for object detection networks, which consists of two main stages. First, we introduce a bounding box and category sampling strategy to synthesize a task-specific calibration set from the pre-trained network, reconstructing object locations, sizes, and category distributions without any prior knowledge. Second, we integrate task-specific training into the knowledge distillation process to restore the performance of quantized detection networks. Extensive experiments conducted on the MS-COCO and Pascal VOC datasets demonstrate the efficiency and state-of-the-art performance of our method.

Together, TIM hosted on TIMRUN supports virtually unlimited working memory and multi-hop tool calls within a single language model inference, overcoming output limits, positional-embedding constraints, and GPU-memory bottlenecks. Performance is achieved by modeling natural language as reasoning trees measured by both length and depth instead of linear sequences. The reasoning trees consist of tasks with thoughts, recursive subtasks, and conclusions based on the concept we proposed in Schroeder et al, 2025. During generation, we maintain a working memory that retains only the key-value states of the most relevant context tokens, selected by a rule-based subtask-pruning mechanism, enabling reuse of positional embeddings and GPU memory pages throughout reasoning. Experimental results show that our system sustains high inference throughput, even when manipulating up to 90% of the KV cache in GPU memory. It also delivers accurate reasoning on mathematical tasks and handles information retrieval challenges that require long-horizon reasoning and multi-hop tool use."

To address this, many recent approaches have explored the use of synthetic data for training face recognition models. However, these models typically underperform compared to those trained on real-world data. A common limitation is that a single generator model is often used to create the entire synthetic dataset, leading to model-specific artifacts that may cause overfitting to the generator's inherent biases and artifacts. In this work, we propose a solution by combining two state-of-the-art synthetic face datasets generated using architecturally distinct backbones. This fusion reduces model-specific artifacts, enhances diversity in pose, lighting, and demographics, and implicitly regularizes the face recognition model by emphasizing identity-relevant features.

Standard approaches to this problem rely on modifying training data, for example by adding data that better specify the intended generalization. However, this is not always practical. We introduce Concept Ablation Fine-Tuning (CAFT), a technique that leverages interpretability tools to control how LLMs generalize from fine-tuning, without needing to modify the training data or otherwise use data from the target distribution. Given a set of directions in an LLM's latent space corresponding to undesired concepts, CAFT works by ablating these concepts with linear projections during fine-tuning, steering the model away from unintended generalizations. We successfully apply CAFT to three fine-tuning tasks, including emergent misalignment, a phenomenon where LLMs fine-tuned on a narrow task generalize to give egregiously misaligned responses to general questions. Without any changes to the fine-tuning data, CAFT reduces misaligned responses by 10x without degrading performance on the training distribution. Overall, CAFT represents a novel approach for steering LLM generalization without modifying training data."

To address these issues, we propose Test-Time-Matching (TTM), a training-free role-playing framework through test-time scaling and context engineering. TTM uses LLM agents to automatically decouple a character's features into personality, memory, and linguistic style. Our framework involves a structured, three-stage generation pipeline that utilizes these features for controlled role-playing. It achieves high-fidelity role-playing performance, also enables seamless combinations across diverse linguistic styles and even variations in personality and memory. We evaluate our framework through human assessment, and the results demonstrate that our method achieves the outstanding performance in generating expressive and stylistically consistent character dialogues."

Today, almost all successful applications of RL for reasoning use binary reward functions that evaluate the correctness of LM outputs. Because such reward functions do not penalize guessing or low-confidence outputs, they often have the unintended side-effect of degrading calibration and increasing the rate at which LMs generate incorrect responses (or \"hallucinate\") in other problem domains. This paper describes RLCR (Reinforcement Learning with Calibration Rewards), an approach to training reasoning models that jointly improves accuracy and calibrated confidence estimation. During RLCR, LMs generate both predictions and numerical confidence estimates after reasoning. They are trained to optimize a reward function that augments a binary correctness score with a Brier score -- a scoring rule for confidence estimates that incentivizes calibrated prediction. We first prove that this reward function (or any analogous reward function that uses a bounded, proper scoring rule) yields models whose predictions are both accurate and well-calibrated. We next show that across diverse datasets, RLCR substantially improves calibration with no loss in accuracy, on both in-domain and out-of-domain evaluations -- outperforming both ordinary RL training and classifiers trained to assign post-hoc confidence scores. While ordinary RL hurts calibration, RLCR improves it. Finally, we demonstrate that verbalized confidence can be leveraged at test time to improve accuracy and calibration via confidence-weighted scaling methods. Our results show that explicitly optimizing for calibration can produce more generally reliable reasoning models."

However, since LVLMs are mainly trained with vision-language alignment, it is difficult to adopt on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) to develop the slow thinking ability because the rollout space is restricted by its initial abilities. Off-policy RL offers a way to go beyond the current policy, but directly distilling trajectories from external models may cause visual hallucinations due to mismatched visual perception abilities across models. To address these issues, this paper proposes SOPHIA, a simple and scalable Semi-Off-Policy RL for vision-language slow-tHInking reAsoning. SOPHIA builds a semi-off-policy behavior model by combining on-policy visual understanding from a trainable LVLM with off-policy slow-thinking reasoning from a language model, assigns outcome-based rewards to reasoning, and propagates visual rewards backward. Then LVLM learns slow-thinking reasoning ability from the obtained reasoning trajectories using propagated rewards via off-policy RL algorithms. Extensive experiments with InternVL2.5 and InternVL3.0 with 8B and 38B sizes show the effectiveness of SOPHIA. Notably, SOPHIA improves InternVL3.0-38B by 8.50% in average, reaching state-of-the-art performance among open-source LVLMs on multiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks, and even outperforms some closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4.1) on the challenging MathVision and OlympiadBench, achieving 49.08% and 49.95% pass@1 accuracy, respectively.

We propose a dual-path scenario retrieval that supports both category-based search for known scenarios and embedding-based retrieval for unknown Out-of-Distribution (OOD) scenarios. To facilitate evaluation, we curate scenario annotations on the Argoverse 2 Sensor Dataset. Experimental results show that our method outperforms rule-based baselines and generalizes well to OOD scenarios."

In this work, we extend the Differential Attention mechanism, originally designed for text-only models, to the text-vision model PaliGemma. Our aim is to evaluate its ability to mitigate noisy information retrieval and reduce hallucinations. To this end, we fine-tuned the PaliGemma 3B model using LoRA, incorporating Differential Attention, and experimented with various parameter settings and configurations. We demonstrate that Differential Attention can be adapted and integrated into the fine-tuning of existing models to enhance noisy information retrieval and question-answering capabilities."

This flexibility, potential, and growing adoption demands a holistic and cross-disciplinary approach to developing, monitoring and discussing the capabilities required for agent-driven user experiences. However, current guidance on human-centered AI agent development is scattered: UX heuristics focus on interface behaviors, engineering taxonomies describe internal pipelines, and ethics checklists address high-level governance. There is no concise, user-facing vocabulary that tells teams what an agent should fundamentally be able to do. We introduce ADEPTS, a capability framework defining a set of core user-facing capabilities to provide unified guidance around the development of AI agents. ADEPTS is based on six principles for human-centered agent design, that express the minimal, user-facing capabilities an AI agent should demonstrate to be understandable, controllable and trustworthy in everyday use. ADEPTS complements existing frameworks and taxonomies; differently from them, it sits at the interface between technical and experience development. By presenting ADEPTS, we aim to condense complex AI-UX requirements into a compact framework that is actionable guidance for AI researchers, designers, engineers, and policy reviewers alike. We believe ADEPTS has the potential of accelerating the improvement of user-relevant agent capabilities, of easing the design of experiences that take advantage of those capabilities, and of providing a shared language to track and discuss progress around the development of AI agents."

In addition, we develop a baseline LM agent, AlgoTuner, and evaluate its performance across a suite of frontier models. AlgoTuner achieves an average 1.72x speedup against our reference solvers, which use libraries such as SciPy, sk-learn and CVXPY.

To address this limitation, we present a novel approach that synthesizes realistically looking pairs of cardiac CT frames enriched with dense 3D flow field annotations.\n  Our method leverages a conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE), which incorporates a novel multi-scale feature conditioning mechanism and is trained to generate 3D flow fields conditioned on a single CT frame. By applying the generated flow field to warp the given frame, we create pairs of frames that simulate realistic myocardium deformations across the cardiac cycle.

In particular, it plays a central role in the development of artificial autonomous agents. As these agents become increasingly capable, market readiness is rapidly approaching, which means those agents, for example taking the form of humanoid robots or autonomous cars, are poised to transition from laboratory prototypes to autonomous operation in real-world environments. This transition raises concerns leading to specific requirements for these systems - among them, the requirement that they are designed to behave ethically. Crucially, research directed toward building agents that fulfill the requirement to behave ethically - referred to as artificial moral agents(AMAs) - has to address a range of challenges at the intersection of computer science and philosophy. This study explores the development of reason-based artificial moral agents (RBAMAs). RBAMAs are build on an extension of the reinforcement learning architecture to enable moral decision-making based on sound normative reasoning, which is achieved by equipping the agent with the capacity to learn a reason-theory - a theory which enables it to process morally relevant propositions to derive moral obligations - through case-based feedback. They are designed such that they adapt their behavior to ensure conformance to these obligations while they pursue their designated tasks. These features contribute to the moral justifiability of the their actions, their moral robustness, and their moral trustworthiness, which proposes the extended architecture as a concrete and deployable framework for the development of AMAs that fulfills key ethical desiderata. This study presents a first implementation of an RBAMA and demonstrates the potential of RBAMAs in initial experiments."

Building off of a previous proof-of-principle successfully demonstrating training set reduction on static pre-labelled datasets, using the ADEPT framework, this strategy was applied again to the plasma turbulent transport problem within tokamak fusion plasmas, specifically the QuaLiKiz quasilinear electrostatic gyrokinetic turbulent transport code. While QuaLiKiz provides relatively fast evaluations, this study specifically targeted small datasets to serve as a proxy for more expensive codes, such as CGYRO or GENE. The newly implemented algorithm uses the SNGP architecture for the classification component of the problem and the BNN-NCP architecture for the regression component, training models for all turbulent modes (ITG, TEM, ETG) and all transport fluxes ($Q_e$, $Q_i$, $\\Gamma_e$, $\\Gamma_i$, and $\\Pi_i$) described by the general QuaLiKiz output. With 45 active learning iterations, moving from a small initial training set of $10^{2}$ to a final set of $10^{4}$, the resulting models reached a $F_1$ classification performance of ~0.8 and a $R^2$ regression performance of ~0.75 on an independent test set across all outputs. This extrapolates to reaching the same performance and efficiency as the previous ADEPT pipeline, although on a problem with 1 extra input dimension. While the improvement rate achieved in this implementation diminishes faster than expected, the overall technique is formulated with components that can be upgraded and generalized to many surrogate modeling applications beyond plasma turbulent transport predictions."

We present a unified hybrid data-driven approach that combines a conditional diffusion model with an exit prediction neural network to capture both interior stochastic dynamics and boundary exit phenomena. Our ML model consists of two major components: a neural network that learns exit probabilities using binary cross-entropy loss with rigorous convergence guarantees, and a training-free diffusion model that generates state transitions for non-exiting particles using closed-form score functions. The two components are integrated through a probabilistic sampling algorithm that determines particle exit at each time step and generates appropriate state transitions. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated via three test cases: a one-dimensional simplified problem for theoretical verification, a two-dimensional advection-diffusion problem in a bounded domain, and a three-dimensional problem of interest to magnetically confined fusion plasmas."

In this work, we represent the synthesis of variational quantum circuits as a sequential decision-making problem, where gates are added iteratively in order to optimize an objective function, and we introduce two reinforcement learning-based methods, RLVQC Global and RLVQC Block, tailored to combinatorial optimization problems. RLVQC Block creates ansatzes that generalize the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), by discovering a two-qubits block that is applied to all the interacting qubit pairs. While RLVQC Global further generalizes the ansatz and adds gates unconstrained by the structure of the interacting qubits. Both methods adopt the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm and use empirical measurement outcomes as state observations to guide the agent. We evaluate the proposed methods on a broad set of QUBO instances derived from classical graph-based optimization problems. Our results show that both RLVQC methods exhibit strong results with RLVQC Block consistently outperforming QAOA and generally surpassing RLVQC Global. While RLVQC Block produces circuits with depth comparable to QAOA, the Global variant is instead able to find significantly shorter ones. These findings suggest that reinforcement learning methods can be an effective tool to discover new ansatz structures tailored for specific problems and that the most effective circuit design strategy lies between rigid predefined architectures and completely unconstrained ones, offering a favourable trade-off between structure and adaptability."

This process is computationally expensive and scales poorly with increasing problem size and hardware complexity. Existing heuristics are often developed for specific problem graphs or hardware topologies and are difficult to generalize. Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising alternative by treating minor embedding as a sequential decision-making problem, where an agent learns to construct minor embeddings by iteratively mapping the problem variables to the hardware qubits.

First, a Clinically-Informed Feature Interpretation Dictionary (CIFID) was created by mapping 56 RFs to BI-RADS descriptors (shape, margin, internal enhancement) through literature and expert review. The framework was applied to classify triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) versus non-TNBC using dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI from a multi-institutional cohort of 1,549 patients. We trained 27 machine learning classifiers with 27 feature selection methods. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were used to interpret predictions and generate a complementary Data-Driven Feature Interpretation Dictionary (DDFID) for 52 additional RFs. The best model, combining Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) selection with Extra Trees Classifier, achieved an average cross-validation accuracy of 0.83. Key predictive RFs aligned with clinical knowledge: higher Sphericity (round/oval shape) and lower Busyness (more homogeneous enhancement) were associated with TNBC. The framework confirmed known imaging biomarkers and uncovered novel, interpretable associations.

Their trajectories exhibit highly non-trivial statistical behavior, motivating the development of surrogate models that can reproduce these trajectories without incurring the high computational cost of direct numerical simulations of the full Eulerian field. This task is particularly challenging because reduced-order models typically lack access to the full set of interactions with the underlying turbulent field. Novel data-driven machine learning techniques can be very powerful in capturing and reproducing complex statistics of the reduced-order/surrogate dynamics. In this work, we show how one can learn a surrogate dynamical system that is able to evolve a turbulent Lagrangian trajectory in a way that is point-wise accurate for short-time predictions (with respect to Kolmogorov time) and stable and statistically accurate at long times. This approach is based on the Mori--Zwanzig formalism, which prescribes a mathematical decomposition of the full dynamical system into resolved dynamics that depend on the current state and the past history of a reduced set of observables and the unresolved orthogonal dynamics due to unresolved degrees of freedom of the initial state. We show how by training this reduced order model on a point-wise error metric on short time-prediction, we are able to correctly learn the dynamics of the Lagrangian turbulence, such that also the long-time statistical behavior is stably recovered at test time. This opens up a range of new applications, for example, for the control of active Lagrangian agents in turbulence."

However, the comparative performance of handcrafted radiomics features (HRF), deep radiomics features (DRF), DL models, and hybrid fusion approaches remains inconsistent across clinical applications. This systematic review analyzed 226 studies published from 2020 to 2025 that applied ML to PET or SPECT imaging for outcome prediction. Each study was evaluated using a 59-item framework covering dataset construction, feature extraction, validation methods, interpretability, and risk of bias. We extracted key details including model type, cancer site, imaging modality, and performance metrics such as accuracy and area under the curve (AUC). PET-based studies (95%) generally outperformed those using SPECT, likely due to higher spatial resolution and sensitivity. DRF models achieved the highest mean accuracy (0.862), while fusion models yielded the highest AUC (0.861). ANOVA confirmed significant differences in performance (accuracy: p=0.0006, AUC: p=0.0027). Common limitations included inadequate handling of class imbalance (59%), missing data (29%), and low population diversity (19%). Only 48% of studies adhered to IBSI standards. These findings highlight the need for standardized pipelines, improved data quality, and explainable AI to support clinical integration."

This conventional process is labor-intensive, inaccessible to non-experts, and inflexible to changes in mission requirements. Here, we propose LAN2CB (Language to Collective Behavior), a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to streamline and generalize the multi-robot coordination pipeline. LAN2CB directly converts natural language mission descriptions into executable Python code for multi-robot systems through two key components: (1) Mission Decomposition for Task Representation, which parses the mission into a task graph with dependencies, and (2) Code Generation, which uses the task graph and a structured knowledge base to generate deployable robot control code. We further introduce a dataset of natural language mission specifications to support development and benchmarking. Experimental results in both simulation and real-world settings show that LAN2CB enables effective and flexible multi-robot coordination from natural language, significantly reducing the need for manual engineering while supporting generalization across mission types.

However, these initiatives face the challenge of validating their results in production environments, particularly those utilizing ML-enabled orchestration, as they are often tested in local networks or laboratory simulations. This paper proposes a large-scale validation method using a network slicing prediction model to forecast latency using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and basic ML algorithms embedded within an NS architecture, evaluated in real large-scale production testbeds. It measures and compares the performance of different DNNs and ML algorithms, considering a distributed database application deployed as a network slice over two large-scale production testbeds. The investigation highlights how AI-based prediction models can enhance network slicing orchestration architectures and presents a seamless, production-ready validation method as an alternative to fully controlled simulations or laboratory setups."

These packages typically assume the data are missing at random (MAR), and impose parametric or smoothing assumptions upon the imputing distributions in a way that allows imputation to proceed even if not all missingness patterns have support in the data. Such assumptions are unrealistic in practice, and induce model misspecification bias on any analysis performed after such imputation.\n  In this paper, we provide a principled alternative. Specifically, we develop a new characterization for the full data law in graphical models of missing data. This characterization is constructive, is easily adapted for the calculation of imputation distributions for both MAR and MNAR (missing not at random) mechanisms, and is able to handle lack of support for certain patterns of missingness. We use this characterization to develop a new imputation algorithm -- Multivariate Imputation via Supported Pattern Recursion (MISPR) -- which uses Gibbs sampling, by analogy with the Multivariate Imputation with Chained Equations (MICE) algorithm, but which is consistent under both MAR and MNAR settings, and is able to handle missing data patterns with no support without imposing additional assumptions beyond those already imposed by the missing data model itself.\n  In simulations, we show MISPR obtains comparable results to MICE when data are MAR, and superior, less biased results when data are MNAR. Our characterization and imputation algorithm based on it are a step towards making principled missing data methods more practical in applied settings, where the data are likely both MNAR and sufficiently high dimensional to yield missing data patterns with no support at available sample sizes."

Recent hybrid CNN-Transformer architectures achieve state-of-the-art results but add significant complexity. In this paper, we propose MLRU++, a Multiscale Lightweight Residual UNETR++ architecture designed to balance segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency. It introduces two key innovations: a Lightweight Channel and Bottleneck Attention Module (LCBAM) that enhances contextual feature encoding with minimal overhead, and a Multiscale Bottleneck Block (M2B) in the decoder that captures fine-grained details via multi-resolution feature aggregation. Experiments on four publicly available benchmark datasets (Synapse, BTCV, ACDC, and Decathlon Lung) demonstrate that MLRU++ achieves state-of-the-art performance, with average Dice scores of 87.57% (Synapse), 93.00% (ACDC), and 81.12% (Lung). Compared to existing leading models, MLRU++ improves Dice scores by 5.38% and 2.12% on Synapse and ACDC, respectively, while significantly reducing parameter count and computational cost. Ablation studies evaluating LCBAM and M2B further confirm the effectiveness of the proposed architectural components.

Respiratory spirogram time series, routinely collected during pulmonary function tests (PFTs), play a critical role in the early detection of repsiratory diseases and in monitoring lung function over time. However, most current AI models for COPD diagnosis are limited to outputting classification results without providing a rationale for their diagnostic process, while current Large Language Models (LLMs) cannot understand spirograms yet, which severely limits their clinical trust and adoption. To tackle this challenge, we leverage a cohort of 234,028 individuals from the UK Biobank (UKB) to propose SpiroLLM, the first multimodal large language model that can understand spirogram. The model extracts morphological features from respiratory curves via a SpiroEncoder and aligns them with PFT numerical values in a unified latent space using a SpiroProjector, ultimately empowering a large language model to generate a comprehensive diagnostic report. Experimental results confirm that SpiroLLM achieved a diagnostic AUROC of 0.8980 (95% CI: 0.8820-0.9132). In a robustness test with missing core data, it maintained a 100% valid response rate, far surpassing the 13.4% of a text-only model and showcasing the superiority of its multimodal design. This work demonstrates the substantial potential of deeply fusing physiological signals with large language models, establishing a new paradigm for the next generation of interpretable and reliable clinical decision support tools."

Where previous attacks have focused mainly on visual models that exploit the difference between human and machine perception, text-based models have also fallen victim to these attacks. However, these attacks often fail to maintain the semantic meaning of the text and similarity. This paper introduces AdvChar, a black-box attack on Interpretable Natural Language Processing Systems, designed to mislead the classifier while keeping the interpretation similar to benign inputs, thus exploiting trust in system transparency. AdvChar achieves this by making less noticeable modifications to text input, forcing the deep learning classifier to make incorrect predictions and preserve the original interpretation. We use an interpretation-focused scoring approach to determine the most critical tokens that, when changed, can cause the classifier to misclassify the input. We apply simple character-level modifications to measure the importance of tokens, minimizing the difference between the original and new text while generating adversarial interpretations similar to benign ones. We thoroughly evaluated AdvChar by testing it against seven NLP models and three interpretation models using benchmark datasets for the classification task. Our experiments show that AdvChar can significantly reduce the prediction accuracy of current deep learning models by altering just two characters on average in input samples."

Using 29,124 open text summaries of death investigations between 2013-2022, we conducted a thematic analysis to identify 12 types of online activities that were considered by investigators or next of kin to be relevant in contextualizing a given suicide death. We then develop a zero-shot learning framework to model these 12 themes at scale, and analyze variation in these themes by decedent characteristics and over time. Our work uncovers several online activities related to harm to self, harm to others, interpersonal interactions, activity levels online, and life events, which correspond to different phases of suicide risk from two prominent suicide theories. We find an association between these themes and decedent characteristics like age, means of death, and interpersonal problems, and many themes became more prevalent during the 2020 COVID-19 lockdowns.

Here, we introduce a fully automated, high-throughput CSP protocol designed to overcome these barriers. The protocol's efficiency is driven by Lavo-NN, a novel neural network potential (NNP) architected and trained specifically for pharmaceutical crystal structure generation and ranking. This NNP-driven crystal generation phase is integrated into a scalable cloud-based workflow. We validate this CSP protocol on an extensive retrospective benchmark of 49 unique molecules, almost all of which are drug-like, successfully generating structures that match all 110 $Z' = 1$ experimental polymorphs. The average CSP in this benchmark is performed with approximately 8.4k CPU hours, which is a significant reduction compared to other protocols. The practical utility of the protocol is further demonstrated through case studies that resolve ambiguities in experimental data and a semi-blinded challenge that successfully identifies and ranks polymorphs of three modern drugs from powder X-ray diffraction patterns alone. By significantly reducing the required time and cost, the protocol enables CSP to be routinely deployed earlier in the drug discovery pipeline, such as during lead optimization. Rapid turnaround times and high throughput also enable CSP that can be run in parallel with experimental screening, providing chemists with real-time insights to guide their work in the lab."

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), as a non-invasive imaging technique, is essential for the early diagnosis of AD. MRI inherently contains both spatial and frequency information, as raw signals are acquired in the frequency domain and reconstructed into spatial images via the Fourier transform. However, most existing AD diagnostic models extract features from a single domain, limiting their capacity to fully capture the complex neuroimaging characteristics of the disease. While some studies have combined spatial and frequency information, they are mostly confined to 2D MRI, leaving the potential of dual-domain analysis in 3D MRI unexplored. To overcome this limitation, we propose Spatio-Frequency Network (SFNet), the first end-to-end deep learning framework that simultaneously leverages spatial and frequency domain information to enhance 3D MRI-based AD diagnosis. SFNet integrates an enhanced dense convolutional network to extract local spatial features and a global frequency module to capture global frequency-domain representations. Additionally, a novel multi-scale attention module is proposed to further refine spatial feature extraction. Experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ANDI) dataset demonstrate that SFNet outperforms existing baselines and reduces computational overhead in classifying cognitively normal (CN) and AD, achieving an accuracy of 95.1%."

Yet common evaluation protocols for sequential recommendations remain insufficiently developed: they often fail to reflect the corresponding recommendation task accurately, or are not aligned with real-world scenarios.\n  Although the widely used leave-one-out split matches next-item prediction, it permits the overlap between training and test periods, which leads to temporal leakage and unrealistically long test horizon, limiting real-world relevance. Global temporal splitting addresses these issues by evaluating on distinct future periods. However, its applications to sequential recommendations remain loosely defined, particularly in terms of selecting target interactions and constructing a validation subset that provides necessary consistency between validation and test metrics.\n  In this paper, we demonstrate that evaluation outcomes can vary significantly across splitting strategies, influencing model rankings and practical deployment decisions. To improve reproducibility in both academic and industrial settings, we systematically compare different splitting strategies for sequential recommendations across multiple datasets and established baselines. Our findings show that prevalent splits, such as leave-one-out, may be insufficiently aligned with more realistic evaluation strategies. Code: https://github.com/monkey0head/time-to-split"

In this paper, a new solving scheme is proposed where the solution is iteratively updated following the updating of the physics-driven neural network (PDNN), the hyperparameters of which are optimized by minimizing the loss function which incorporates the constraints from the collected scattered fields and the prior information about scatterers. Unlike data-driven neural network solvers, PDNN is trained only requiring the input of collected scattered fields and the computation of scattered fields corresponding to predicted solutions, thus avoids the generalization problem. Moreover, to accelerate the imaging efficiency, the subregion enclosing the scatterers is identified. Numerical and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme has high reconstruction accuracy and strong stability, even when dealing with composite lossy scatterers."

This raises serious concerns about unintended exposure and potential misuse. Red teaming, which aims to proactively identify diverse prompts that can elicit unsafe outputs from the T2I system (including the core generative model as well as potential external safety filters and other processing components), is increasingly recognized as an essential method for assessing and improving safety before real-world deployment. Yet, existing automated red teaming approaches often treat prompt discovery as an isolated, prompt-level optimization task, which limits their scalability, diversity, and overall effectiveness. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose DREAM, a scalable red teaming framework to automatically uncover diverse problematic prompts from a given T2I system. Unlike most prior works that optimize prompts individually, DREAM directly models the probabilistic distribution of the target system's problematic prompts, which enables explicit optimization over both effectiveness and diversity, and allows efficient large-scale sampling after training. To achieve this without direct access to representative training samples, we draw inspiration from energy-based models and reformulate the objective into simple and tractable objectives. We further introduce GC-SPSA, an efficient optimization algorithm that provide stable gradient estimates through the long and potentially non-differentiable T2I pipeline. The effectiveness of DREAM is validated through extensive experiments, demonstrating that it surpasses 9 state-of-the-art baselines by a notable margin across a broad range of T2I models and safety filters in terms of prompt success rate and diversity."

To bridge this gap, we introduce Multi-OSCC, a new histopathology image dataset comprising 1,325 OSCC patients, integrating both diagnostic and prognostic information to expand existing public resources. Each patient is represented by six high resolution histopathology images captured at x200, x400, and x1000 magnifications-two per magnification-covering both the core and edge tumor regions.The Multi-OSCC dataset is richly annotated for six critical clinical tasks: recurrence prediction (REC), lymph node metastasis (LNM), tumor differentiation (TD), tumor invasion (TI), cancer embolus (CE), and perineural invasion (PI). To benchmark this dataset, we systematically evaluate the impact of different visual encoders, multi-image fusion techniques, stain normalization, and multi-task learning frameworks. Our analysis yields several key insights: (1) The top-performing models achieve excellent results, with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 94.72% for REC and 81.23% for TD, while all tasks surpass 70% AUC; (2) Stain normalization benefits diagnostic tasks but negatively affects recurrence prediction; (3) Multi-task learning incurs a 3.34% average AUC degradation compared to single-task models in our multi-task benchmark, underscoring the challenge of balancing multiple tasks in our dataset.

This ability relies on a background theory and negative examples, both carefully selected with expert knowledge of a learning problem and its solutions. But what if such a problem-specific background theory or negative examples are not available? We formalise this question as a new setting for Self-Supervised ILP and present a new MIL algorithm that learns in the new setting from some positive labelled, and zero or more unlabelled examples, and automatically generates, and labels, new positive and negative examples during learning. We implement this algorithm in Prolog in a new MIL system, called Poker. We compare Poker to state-of-the-art MIL system Louise on experiments learning grammars for Context-Free and L-System languages from labelled, positive example strings, no negative examples, and just the terminal vocabulary of a language, seen in examples, as a first-order background theory. We introduce a new approach for the principled selection of a second-order background theory as a Second Order Definite Normal Form (SONF), sufficiently general to learn all programs in a class, thus removing the need for a backgound theory tailored to a learning task. We find that Poker's performance improves with increasing numbers of automatically generated examples while Louise, bereft of negative examples, over-generalises."

Non-Gaussianity is also a crucial assumption for identifying latent factors in ICA. We provide the first theoretical and empirical insights into this connection, showing that ICA can be used for causal effect estimation in the PLR model.

However, identifying suitable sensing probes and measurement schemes can be a classically intractable task, as it requires optimizing over Hilbert spaces of high dimension. In variational quantum sensing, a probe quantum system is generated via a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC), exposed to an unknown physical parameter through a quantum channel, and measured to collect classical data. PQCs and measurements are typically optimized using offline strategies based on frequentist learning criteria. This paper introduces an adaptive protocol that uses Bayesian inference to optimize the sensing policy via the maximization of the active information gain. The proposed variational methodology is tailored for non-asymptotic regimes where a single probe can be deployed in each time step, and is extended to support the fusion of estimates from multiple quantum sensing agents."

Currently, research is scarce on how participants assess varying robot behaviors in combination with diverse human needs, likely since participants have limited real-world experience with advanced domestic robots. In the current study, we aim to address this gap while using methods that enable participants to assess robot behavior, as well as methods that support meaningful reflection despite limited experience. In an online study, 112 participants (from both experimental and control groups) evaluated 7 videos from a total of 28 variations of human-robot collaboration types. The experimental group first completed a cognitive-affective mapping (CAM) exercise on human-robot collaboration before providing their ratings. Although CAM reflection did not significantly affect overall ratings, it led to more pronounced assessments for certain combinations of robot behavior and human condition. Most importantly, the type of human-robot collaboration influences the assessment. Antisocial robot behavior was consistently rated as the lowest, while collaboration with aged individuals elicited more sensitive evaluations. Scenarios involving object handovers were viewed more positively than those without them. These findings suggest that both human characteristics and interaction paradigms influence the perceived acceptability of collaborative robots, underscoring the importance of prosocial design. They also highlight the potential of reflective methods, such as CAM, to elicit nuanced feedback, supporting the development of user-centered and socially responsible robotic systems tailored to diverse populations."

Drawing on the E-T-C analysis (deployment environment, threat source, enabling capability) from the Frontier AI Risk Management Framework (v1.0) (SafeWork-F1-Framework), we identify critical risks in seven areas: cyber offense, biological and chemical risks, persuasion and manipulation, uncontrolled autonomous AI R\\&amp;D, strategic deception and scheming, self-replication, and collusion. Guided by the \"AI-$45^\\circ$ Law,\" we evaluate these risks using \"red lines\" (intolerable thresholds) and \"yellow lines\" (early warning indicators) to define risk zones: green (manageable risk for routine deployment and continuous monitoring), yellow (requiring strengthened mitigations and controlled deployment), and red (necessitating suspension of development and/or deployment). Experimental results show that all recent frontier AI models reside in green and yellow zones, without crossing red lines. Specifically, no evaluated models cross the yellow line for cyber offense or uncontrolled AI R\\&amp;D risks. For self-replication, and strategic deception and scheming, most models remain in the green zone, except for certain reasoning models in the yellow zone. In persuasion and manipulation, most models are in the yellow zone due to their effective influence on humans. For biological and chemical risks, we are unable to rule out the possibility of most models residing in the yellow zone, although detailed threat modeling and in-depth assessment are required to make further claims. This work reflects our current understanding of AI frontier risks and urges collective action to mitigate these challenges."

The paper presents a novel image synthesis network, the Pyramid Hierarchical Masked Diffusion Model (PHMDiff), which employs a multi-scale hierarchical approach for more detailed control over synthesizing high-quality images across different resolutions and layers. Specifically, this model utilizes randomly multi-scale high-proportion masks to speed up diffusion model training, and balances detail fidelity and overall structure. The integration of a Transformer-based Diffusion model process incorporates cross-granularity regularization, modeling the mutual information consistency across each granularity's latent spaces, thereby enhancing pixel-level perceptual accuracy. Comprehensive experiments on two challenging datasets demonstrate that PHMDiff achieves superior performance in both the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM), highlighting its capability to produce high-quality synthesized images with excellent structural integrity. Ablation studies further confirm the contributions of each component. Furthermore, the PHMDiff model, a multi-scale image synthesis framework across and within medical imaging modalities, shows significant advantages over other methods.

This approach integrates graph neural networks (GNNs) within the iterative Proximal Regularized Gauss Newton (PRGN) framework. By unrolling the PRGN algorithm, where each iteration corresponds to a network layer, we leverage the physical insights of nonlinear model fitting alongside the GNN's capacity to capture inter-frequency correlations.

Existing theoretical analyses of RLDA often lack clear insight into how data structure affects classification performance. To address this issue, we derive a non-asymptotic approximation of the misclassification rate and thus analyze the structural effect and structural adjustment strategies of RLDA. Based on this, we propose the Spectral Enhanced Discriminant Analysis (SEDA) algorithm, which optimizes the data structure by adjusting the spiked eigenvalues of the population covariance matrix. By developing a new theoretical result on eigenvectors in random matrix theory, we derive an asymptotic approximation on the misclassification rate of SEDA. The bias correction algorithm and parameter selection strategy are then obtained. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets show that SEDA achieves higher classification accuracy and dimensionality reduction compared to existing LDA methods."

This paper presents ExpTeach, a framework that grounds VLMs to physical robots by building a self-generated memory of real-world experiences. In ExpTeach, the VLM autonomously plans actions, verifies outcomes, reflects on failures, and adapts robot behaviors in a closed loop. The self-generated experiences during this process are then summarized into a long-term memory, enabling retrieval of learned knowledge to guide future tasks via retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Additionally, ExpTeach enhances the spatial understanding of VLMs with an on-demand image annotation module. In experiments, we show that reflection improves success rates from 36% to 84% on four challenging robotic tasks and observe the emergence of intelligent object interactions, including creative tool use. Across extensive tests on 12 real-world scenarios (including eight unseen ones), we find that grounding with long-term memory boosts single-trial success rates from 22% to 80%, demonstrating the effectiveness and generalizability of ExpTeach."

However, compared to features in conventional photographs, nanoscale defects in TEM images exhibit far greater variation due to the complex contrast mechanisms and intricate defect structures. These challenges often result in much less labeled data and higher rates of annotation errors, posing significant obstacles to improving machine learning model performance for TEM image analysis. To address these limitations, we examined transfer learning by leveraging large, pre-trained models used for natural images.\n  We demonstrated that by using the pre-trained encoder and L2-regularization, semantically complex features are ignored in favor of simpler, more reliable cues, substantially improving the model performance. However, this improvement cannot be captured by conventional evaluation metrics such as F1-score, which can be skewed by human annotation errors treated as ground truth. Instead, we introduced novel evaluation metrics that are independent of the annotation accuracy. Using grain boundary detection in UO2 TEM images as a case study, we found that our approach led to a 57% improvement in defect detection rate, which is a robust and holistic measure of model performance on the TEM dataset used in this work. Finally, we showed that model self-confidence is only achieved through transfer learning and fine-tuning of very deep layers."

However, traditional deep learning methods for semantic segmentation often encounter limitations due to the scarcity of labeled data, visually ambiguous features of interest, and small-object scenarios. To tackle these challenges, we introduce MultiTaskDeltaNet (MTDN), a novel deep learning architecture that creatively reconceptualizes the segmentation task as a change detection problem. By implementing a unique Siamese network with a U-Net backbone and using paired images to capture feature changes, MTDN effectively utilizes minimal data to produce high-quality segmentations. Furthermore, MTDN utilizes a multi-task learning strategy to leverage correlations between physical features of interest. In an evaluation using data from in-situ environmental TEM (ETEM) videos of filamentous carbon gasification, MTDN demonstrated a significant advantage over conventional segmentation models, particularly in accurately delineating fine structural features. Notably, MTDN achieved a 10.22% performance improvement over conventional segmentation models in predicting small and visually ambiguous physical features. This work bridges several key gaps between deep learning and practical TEM image analysis, advancing automated characterization of nanomaterials in complex experimental settings."

While the airports are more likely to become hotspots for potential conflicts to break out which can cause serious delays to flights and several safety issues. An intelligent algorithm which renders security surveillance more effective in detecting conflicts would bring many benefits to the passengers in terms of their safety, finance, and travelling efficiency. This paper details the development of a machine learning model to classify conflicting behaviour in a crowd. HRNet is used to segment the images and then two approaches are taken to classify the poses of people in the frame via multiple classifiers. Among them, it was found that the support vector machine (SVM) achieved the most performant achieving precision of 94.37%. Where the model falls short is against ambiguous behaviour such as a hug or losing track of a subject in the frame. The resulting model has potential for deployment within an airport if improvements are made to cope with the vast number of potential passengers in view as well as training against further ambiguous behaviours which will arise in an airport setting. In turn, will provide the capability to enhance security surveillance and improve airport safety."

However, many of the defining assumptions regarding data-stream learning tasks are too strong to hold in practice, or are even contradictory such that they cannot be met in the contexts of supervised learning. Algorithms are chosen and designed based on criteria which are often not clearly stated, for problem settings not clearly defined, tested in unrealistic settings, and/or in isolation from related approaches in the wider literature. This puts into question the potential for real-world impact of many approaches conceived in such contexts, and risks propagating a misguided research focus. We propose to tackle these issues by reformulating the fundamental definitions and settings of supervised data-stream learning with regard to contemporary considerations of concept drift and temporal dependence; and we take a fresh look at what constitutes a supervised data-stream learning task, and a reconsideration of algorithms that may be applied to tackle such tasks. Through and in reflection of this formulation and overview, helped by an informal survey of industrial players dealing with real-world data streams, we provide recommendations. Our main emphasis is that learning from data streams does not impose a single-pass or online-learning approach, or any particular learning regime; and any constraints on memory and time are not specific to streaming. Meanwhile, there exist established techniques for dealing with temporal dependence and concept drift, in other areas of the literature. For the data streams community, we thus encourage a shift in research focus, from dealing with often-artificial constraints and assumptions on the learning mode, to issues such as robustness, privacy, and interpretability which are increasingly relevant to learning in data streams in academic and industrial settings."

However, effectively capturing the diverse characteristics of RTS data in FCL systems poses significant challenges, including severely impacting computational and communication resources, escalating energy costs, and ultimately degrading overall system performance. To overcome these challenges, we investigate how the data distribution shift from ideal to practical RTS scenarios affects Artificial Intelligence (AI) model performance by leveraging the \\textit{generalization gap} concept. In this way, we can analyze how sampling time in RTS correlates with the decline in AI performance, computation cost, and communication efficiency. Based on this observation, we develop a novel Sample-driven Control for Federated Continual Learning (SCFL) technique, specifically designed for mobile edge networks with RTS capabilities. In particular, SCFL is an optimization problem that harnesses the sampling process to concurrently minimize the generalization gap and improve overall accuracy while upholding the energy efficiency of the FCL framework. To solve the highly complex and time-varying optimization problem, we introduce a new soft actor-critic algorithm with explicit and implicit constraints (A2C-EI). Our empirical experiments reveal that we can achieve higher efficiency compared to other DRL baselines. Notably, SCFL can significantly reduce energy consumption up to $85\\%$ while maintaining FL convergence and timely data transmission."

Our study conducts an extensive comparison of multiple KD techniques, including standard KD, tuned KD (via optimized temperature and weight parameters), deep mutual learning, and data partitioning KD. We assess these methods across various data distribution strategies to identify the most effective contexts for each. Through detailed examination of hyperparameter tuning, informed by extensive grid search evaluations, we pinpoint when adjustments are crucial to enhance model performance. This paper sheds light on optimal hyperparameter settings for distinct data partitioning scenarios and investigates KD's role in improving federated learning by minimizing communication rounds and expediting the training process.

Motivated by the conundrum of keeping high data quality and low privacy risk of synthetic data tables, we propose DPTLDM, Differentially Private Tabular Latent Diffusion Model, which is composed of an autoencoder network to encode the tabular data and a latent diffusion model to synthesize the latent tables. Following the emerging f-DP framework, we apply DP-SGD to train the auto-encoder in combination with batch clipping and use the separation value as the privacy metric to better capture the privacy gain from DP algorithms. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that DPTLDM is capable of achieving a meaningful theoretical privacy guarantee while also significantly enhancing the utility of synthetic data. Specifically, compared to other DP-protected tabular generative models, DPTLDM improves the synthetic quality by an average of 35% in data resemblance, 15% in the utility for downstream tasks, and 50% in data discriminability, all while preserving a comparable level of privacy risk."

The semantics, context, and structure of an image can evoke emotional responses, making emotional image editing techniques valuable for various real-world applications, including treatment of psychological disorders, commercialization of products, and artistic design. First, we present a novel challenge of emotion-evoked image generation, aiming to synthesize images that evoke target emotions while retaining the semantics and structures of the original scenes. To address this challenge, we propose a diffusion model capable of effectively understanding and editing source images to convey desired emotions and sentiments. Moreover, due to the lack of emotion editing datasets, we provide a unique dataset consisting of 340,000 pairs of images and their emotion annotations. Furthermore, we conduct human psychophysics experiments and introduce a new evaluation metric to systematically benchmark all the methods. Experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses all competitive baselines. Our diffusion model is capable of identifying emotional cues from original images, editing images that elicit desired emotions, and meanwhile, preserving the semantic structure of the original images. All code, model, and dataset are available at GitHub."

Religious texts are expressions of culturally important values, and machine learned models have a propensity to reproduce cultural values encoded in their training data. Furthermore, translations of religious texts are frequently used by NLP researchers when language data is scarce. This repurposes the translations from their original uses and motivations, which often involve attracting new followers. This paper argues that NLP's use of such texts raises considerations that go beyond model biases, including data provenance, cultural contexts, and their use in proselytism. We argue for more consideration of researcher positionality, and of the perspectives of marginalized linguistic and religious communities."

While neural solvers trained from either simulation data or physics-informed loss can solve PDEs reasonably well, they are mainly restricted to a few instances of PDEs, e.g. a certain equation with a limited set of coefficients. This limits their generalization to diverse PDEs, preventing them from being practical surrogate models of numerical solvers. In this paper, we present Unisolver, a novel Transformer model trained on diverse data and conditioned on diverse PDEs, aiming towards a universal neural PDE solver capable of solving a wide scope of PDEs. Instead of purely scaling up data and parameters, Unisolver stems from the theoretical analysis of the PDE-solving process. Inspired by the mathematical structure of PDEs that a PDE solution is fundamentally governed by a series of PDE components such as equation symbols and boundary conditions, we define a complete set of PDE components and flexibly embed them as domain-wise and point-wise deep conditions for Transformer PDE solvers. Integrating physical insights with recent Transformer advances, Unisolver achieves consistent state-of-the-art on three challenging large-scale benchmarks, showing impressive performance and generalizability.

Each case included a defaced 3D post-contrast T1-weighted radiotherapy planning MRI in its native acquisition space, accompanied by a single-label \"target volume\" representing the gross tumor volume (GTV) and any at-risk post-operative site. Target volume annotations adhered to established radiotherapy planning protocols, ensuring consistency across cases and institutions, and were approved by expert neuroradiologists and radiation oncologists. Six participating teams developed, containerized, and evaluated automated segmentation models using this comprehensive dataset. Team rankings were assessed using a modified lesion-wise Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and 95% Hausdorff Distance (95HD). The best reported average lesion-wise DSC and 95HD was 0.815 and 26.92 mm, respectively. BraTS-MEN-RT is expected to significantly advance automated radiotherapy planning by enabling precise tumor segmentation and facilitating tailored treatment, ultimately improving patient outcomes.

The use of network information is increasingly being explored to effectively combat money laundering, given it involves connected parties. This led to a surge in research on network analytics for anti-money laundering (AML). The literature is, however, fragmented and a comprehensive overview of existing work is missing. This results in limited understanding of the methods to apply and their comparative detection power. This paper presents an extensive and unique literature review, based on 97 papers from Web of Science and Scopus, resulting in a taxonomy following a recently proposed fraud analytics framework. We conclude that most research relies on expert-based rules and manual features, while deep learning methods have been gaining traction. This paper also presents a comprehensive framework to evaluate and compare the performance of prominent methods in a standardized setup. We compare manual feature engineering, random walk-based, and deep learning methods on two publicly available data sets. We conclude that (1) network analytics increases the predictive power, but caution is needed when applying GNNs in the face of class imbalance and network topology, and that (2) care should be taken with synthetic data as this can give overly optimistic results. The open-source implementation facilitates researchers and practitioners to extend this work on proprietary data, promoting a standardised approach for the analysis and evaluation of network analytics for AML."

This failure under asynchrony effectively excludes these architectures from many potential applications where synchrony is difficult or impossible to enforce, e.g., robotic swarms or sensor networks. In this work we identify \"implicitly-defined\" GNNs as a class of architectures which is provably robust to asynchronous \"hogwild\" inference, adapting convergence guarantees from work in asynchronous and distributed optimization. We then propose a novel implicitly-defined GNN architecture, which we call an 'energy GNN'.

However, the enormous number of model parameters makes fine-tuning challenging, significantly limiting their application and deployment. Existing solutions combine parameter quantization with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), reducing memory usage but causing performance degradation. Additionally, converting fine-tuned models to low-precision representations further degrades performance. In this paper, we identify an imbalance in fine-tuning quantized LLMs with LoRA: overly complex adapter inputs and outputs versus low effective trainability of the adapter, leading to underfitting during fine-tuning. Thus, we propose Quantized LLMs fine-tuning with Balanced Low-Rank Adaptation (Q-BLoRA), which simplifies the adapter's inputs and outputs while increasing the adapter's rank to alleviate underfitting during fine-tuning. For low-precision deployment, we propose Quantization-Aware fine-tuning with Balanced Low-Rank Adaptation (QA-BLoRA), which aligns with the block-wise quantization and facilitates quantization-aware fine-tuning of low-rank adaptation based on the parameter merging of Q-BLoRA. Both Q-BLoRA and QA-BLoRA are easily implemented and offer the following optimizations: (i) Q-BLoRA consistently achieves state-of-the-art accuracy compared to baselines and other variants; (ii) QA-BLoRA enables the direct generation of low-precision inference models, which exhibit significant performance improvements over other low-precision models. We validate the effectiveness of Q-BLoRA and QA-BLoRA across various models and scenarios.\n  Code will be made available at \\href{https://github.com/xiaocaigou/qbaraqahira}{https://github.com/xiaocaigou/qbaraqahira}"

However, the issue of lacking controllability of such models restricts their practical applicability for real-life content creation. Thus, attention has been focused on leveraging a reference image to control text-to-image synthesis, which is also regarded as manipulating (or editing) a reference image as per a text prompt, namely, text-driven image-to-image translation. This paper contributes a novel, concise, and efficient approach that adapts pre-trained large-scale text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model to the image-to-image (I2I) paradigm in a plug-and-play manner, realizing high-quality and versatile text-driven I2I translation without any model training, model fine-tuning, or online optimization process. To guide T2I generation with a reference image, we propose to decompose diverse guiding factors with different frequency bands of diffusion features in the DCT spectral space, and accordingly devise a novel frequency band substitution layer which realizes dynamic control of the reference image to the T2I generation result in a plug-and-play manner. We demonstrate that our method allows flexible control over both guiding factor and guiding intensity of the reference image simply by tuning the type and bandwidth of the substituted frequency band, respectively. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments verify superiority of our approach over related methods in I2I translation visual quality, versatility, and controllability.

However, the server cannot directly monitor the local training processes, leaving room for malicious clients to introduce backdoors into the model. Research has shown that backdoor attacks exploit specific neurons that are activated only by malicious inputs, remaining dormant with clean data. Building on this insight, we propose a novel defense method called Flipping Weight Updates of Low-Activation Input Neurons (FLAIN) to counter backdoor attacks in FL. Specifically, upon the completion of global training, we use an auxiliary dataset to identify low-activation input neurons and iteratively flip their associated weight updates. This flipping process continues while progressively raising the threshold for low-activation neurons, until the model's performance on the auxiliary data begins to degrade significantly. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FLAIN effectively reduces the success rate of backdoor attacks across a variety of scenarios, including Non-IID data distributions and high malicious client ratios (MCR), while maintaining minimal impact on the performance of clean data."

In this paper, we introduce a dual-branch, training-free method called VitaGlyph, enabling flexible artistic typography with controllable geometry changes while maintaining the readability. The key insight of VitaGlyph is to treat input character as a scene composed of a Subject and its Surrounding, which are rendered with varying degrees of geometric transformation. To enhance the visual appeal and creativity of the generated artistic typography, the subject flexibly expresses the essential concept of the input character, while the surrounding enriches relevant background without altering the shape, thus maintaining overall readability. Specifically, we implement VitaGlyph through a three-phase framework: (i) Knowledge Acquisition leverages large language models to design text descriptions for the subject and surrounding. (ii) Regional Interpretation detects the part that most closely matches the subject description and refines the structure via Semantic Typography. (iii) Attentional Compositional Generation separately renders the textures of the Subject and Surrounding regions and blends them in an attention-based manner. Experimental results demonstrate that VitaGlyph not only achieves better artistry and readability but also manages to depict multiple customized concepts, facilitating more creative and pleasing artistic typography generation.

We conducted a two-step study: interviews with 10 journalists established a baseline understanding of expert video interpretation; 114 individuals through deliberation using InclusiveAI, a platform that facilitates democratic decision-making through decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) mechanisms. Our findings reveal distinct differences in interpretative priorities: while experts emphasized emotion and narrative, the general public prioritized factual clarity, objectivity, and emotional neutrality. Furthermore, we examined how different governance mechanisms - quadratic vs. weighted voting and equal vs. 20/80 voting power - shape users' decision-making regarding AI behavior. Results indicate that voting methods significantly influence outcomes, with quadratic voting reinforcing perceptions of liberal democracy and political equality.

ELM applies this framework to create targeted low-rank updates that reduce generation probabilities for concept-specific content while preserving the model's broader capabilities. We demonstrate ELM's efficacy on biosecurity, cybersecurity, and literary domain erasure tasks. Comparative evaluation reveals that ELM-modified models achieve near-random performance on assessments targeting erased concepts, while simultaneously preserving generation coherence, maintaining benchmark performance on unrelated tasks, and exhibiting strong robustness to adversarial attacks.

To assess these unproven abilities of MLLMs, this paper proposes a new visual grounding task called multi-context visual grounding, which aims to localize instances of interest across multiple images based on open-ended text prompts. In order to facilitate this research, we construct a new dataset MC-Bench that features 2K high-quality and manually annotated samples. Each sample consists of an instance-level labeled image pair and a corresponding text prompt that indicates the target instances in the images. These text prompts are highly open-ended and follow three distinct styles, covering 20 practical skills. We benchmark over 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs and foundation models with potential multi-context visual grounding capabilities, along with our developed simple yet effective agentic baseline and a finetuned baseline by multi-context instruction tuning. Our evaluation reveals a non-trivial performance gap between existing MLLMs and humans, along with some insightful observations that suggest potential future directions. We hope that MC-Bench and our empirical findings encourage the research community to further advance the untapped potentials of MLLMs in instance-level tasks, particularly in multi-image contexts.

Confidence calibration, which estimates the underlying uncertainty of model predictions, is essential to enhance the LLMs' trustworthiness. Existing research on LLM calibration has primarily focused on short-form tasks, providing a single confidence score at the response level (macro calibration). However, this approach is insufficient for long-form generations, where responses often contain more complex statements and may include both accurate and inaccurate information. Therefore, we introduce atomic calibration, a novel approach that evaluates factuality calibration at a fine-grained level by breaking down long responses into atomic claims. We classify confidence elicitation methods into discriminative and generative types and demonstrate that their combination can enhance calibration. Our extensive experiments on various LLMs and datasets show that atomic calibration is well-suited for long-form generation and can also improve macro calibration results. Additionally, atomic calibration reveals insightful patterns in LLM confidence throughout the generation process."

It utilizes a 4D Gaussian representation and a GPU-friendly rasterizer, enabling rapid rendering speeds. Despite its advantages, 4DGS faces significant challenges, notably the requirement of millions of 4D Gaussians, each with extensive associated attributes, leading to substantial memory and storage cost. This paper introduces a memory-efficient framework for 4DGS. We streamline the color attribute by decomposing it into a per-Gaussian direct color component with only 3 parameters and a shared lightweight alternating current color predictor. This approach eliminates the need for spherical harmonics coefficients, which typically involve up to 144 parameters in classic 4DGS, thereby creating a memory-efficient 4D Gaussian representation. Furthermore, we introduce an entropy-constrained Gaussian deformation technique that uses a deformation field to expand the action range of each Gaussian and integrates an opacity-based entropy loss to limit the number of Gaussians, thus forcing our model to use as few Gaussians as possible to fit a dynamic scene well. With simple half-precision storage and zip compression, our framework achieves a storage reduction by approximately 190$\\times$ and 125$\\times$ on the Technicolor and Neural 3D Video datasets, respectively, compared to the original 4DGS. Meanwhile, it maintains comparable rendering speeds and scene representation quality, setting a new standard in the field. Code is available at https://github.com/Xinjie-Q/MEGA."

In this paper, we propose GraspDiffusion, a novel generative method that creates realistic scenes of human-object interaction. Given a 3D object mesh, GraspDiffusion first constructs life-like whole-body poses with control over the object's location relative to the human body. This is achieved by separately leveraging the generative priors for 3D body and hand poses, optimizing them into a joint grasping pose. The resulting pose guides the image synthesis to correctly reflect the intended interaction, allowing the creation of realistic and diverse human-object interaction scenes. We demonstrate that GraspDiffusion can successfully tackle the relatively uninvestigated problem of generating full-bodied human-object interactions while outperforming previous methods.

One natural hypothesis is that the CLIP vision encoder does not embed essential information for these tasks. However, we find that this is not always the case: The encoder gathers query-relevant visual information, while CLIP fails to extract it. In particular, we show that another branch of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Generative Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), achieve significantly higher accuracy than CLIP in many of these tasks using the same vision encoder and weights, indicating that these Generative MLLMs perceive more -- as they extract and utilize visual information more effectively. We conduct a series of controlled experiments and reveal that their success is attributed to multiple key design choices, including patch tokens, position embeddings, and prompt-based weighting. On the other hand, enhancing the training data alone or applying a stronger text encoder does not suffice to solve the task, and additional text tokens offer little benefit. Interestingly, we find that fine-grained visual reasoning is not exclusive to generative models trained by an autoregressive loss: When converted into CLIP-like encoders by contrastive finetuning, these MLLMs still outperform CLIP under the same cosine similarity-based evaluation protocol. Our study highlights the importance of VLM architectural choices and suggests directions for improving the performance of CLIP-like contrastive VLMs."

Beyond modality gaps, individual variations, such as differences in organ size and metabolic rate, further impede a model's ability to generalize effectively across both modalities and diverse populations. Despite the importance of personalization, existing approaches to multi-modal generalization often neglect individual differences, focusing solely on common anatomical features. This limitation may result in weakened generalization in various medical tasks. In this paper, we unveil that personalization is critical for multi-modal generalization. Specifically, we propose an approach to achieve personalized generalization through approximating the underlying personalized invariant representation ${X}_h$ across various modalities by leveraging individual-level constraints and a learnable biological prior. We validate the feasibility and benefits of learning a personalized ${X}_h$, showing that this representation is highly generalizable and transferable across various multi-modal medical tasks.

This restricts applications in real-world scenarios where parts of the image may come from different sources or have been edited. We introduce a deep-learning model for localized image watermarking, dubbed the Watermark Anything Model (WAM). The WAM embedder imperceptibly modifies the input image, while the extractor segments the received image into watermarked and non-watermarked areas and recovers one or several hidden messages from the areas found to be watermarked. The models are jointly trained at low resolution and without perceptual constraints, then post-trained for imperceptibility and multiple watermarks. Experiments show that WAM is competitive with state-of-the art methods in terms of imperceptibility and robustness, especially against inpainting and splicing, even on high-resolution images. Moreover, it offers new capabilities: WAM can locate watermarked areas in spliced images and extract distinct 32-bit messages with less than 1 bit error from multiple small regions -- no larger than 10% of the image surface -- even for small 256x256 images.

To this end, we introduce a versatile simulation framework that applies physically consistent rotations and flips to Mueller matrices, tailored to maintain polarization fidelity. Our experimental results across multiple datasets reveal that conventional augmentations can lead to falsified results when applied to polarimetric data, underscoring the necessity of our physics-based approach. In our experiments, we first compare our polarization-specific augmentations against real-world captures to validate their physical consistency. We then apply these augmentations in a semantic segmentation task, achieving substantial improvements in model generalization and performance. This study underscores the necessity of physics-informed data augmentation for polarimetric imaging in deep learning (DL), paving the way for broader adoption and more robust applications across diverse research in the field.

The success of these models can largely be attributed to the dominant scaling law, which states that larger parameter sizes and data volumes contribute to better performance. Notably, data scaling has been primarily driven by automatic data pipelines, which focus on the self-instruction of LLMs. The paradigm has been taken for granted for quite some time, but the study of the effectiveness of scaling with these data has been neglected for a long time. In this context, this work revisits scaling with synthetic data and focuses on developing video-LLMs from a data-centric perspective. Our primary study approach involves fine-tuning pre-trained image-LLMs with video data and examining learning efficiency through data scaling. Results from our preliminary experiments reveal a low learning efficiency phenomenon when simply scaling up video data samples, which, through our probing, can be ascribed to a lack of instruction diversity. Aiming at this issue, we propose a data augmentation method called Sparrow, which synthesizes video-like samples from pure text instruction data. Mixing these synthetic samples with the video data enables a more efficient training scheme. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed method achieves performance comparable to or even superior to that of baselines trained with significantly more samples. Meanwhile, we find that incorporating these synthetic samples can enhance the performance of long video understanding without requiring training on long video data.

After passing through the prompt encoder, their embedding representations can further improve the segmentation performance by incorporating more relevant information without adding significant training overhead. Additionally, we adopt an effective modality-based data sampling strategy to address data imbalance between modalities, ensuring more balanced performance across all modalities.

Our solution is to construct a training set consisting of distortion levels along with their \"non-reliable\" or \"reliable\" labels, and train a machine learning predictive model (called distortion-classifier) to classify unseen distortion levels. However, learning an effective distortion-classifier is a challenging problem as the training set is highly imbalanced.

In this regime, what stabilizes at $2/\\eta$ is *Batch Sharpness*: the expected directional curvature of mini-batch Hessians along their corresponding stochastic gradients. As a consequence $\\lambda_{\\max}$ -- which is generally smaller than Batch Sharpness -- is suppressed, aligning with the long-standing empirical observation that smaller batches and larger step sizes favor flatter minima.

While research on visual emotion analysis is extensive, limited work has been done on helping users generate emotionally rich image content. Existing work on emotional image generation relies on discrete emotion categories, making it challenging to capture complex and subtle emotional nuances accurately. Additionally, these methods struggle to control the specific content of generated images based on text prompts. In this work, we introduce the new task of continuous emotional image content generation (C-EICG) and present EmotiCrafter, an emotional image generation model that generates images based on text prompts and Valence-Arousal values. Specifically, we propose a novel emotion-embedding mapping network that embeds Valence-Arousal values into textual features, enabling the capture of specific emotions in alignment with intended input prompts. Additionally, we introduce a loss function to enhance emotion expression. The experimental results show that our method effectively generates images representing specific emotions with the desired content and outperforms existing techniques."

In this study, we present RadAlign, a novel framework that combines the predictive accuracy of vision-language models (VLMs) with the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Inspired by the radiologist's workflow, RadAlign first employs a specialized VLM to align visual features with key medical concepts, achieving superior disease classification with an average AUC of 0.885 across multiple diseases. These recognized medical conditions, represented as text-based concepts in the aligned visual-language space, are then used to prompt LLM-based report generation. Enhanced by a retrieval-augmented generation mechanism that grounds outputs in similar historical cases, RadAlign delivers superior report quality with a GREEN score of 0.678, outperforming state-of-the-art methods' 0.634.

While semantic and domain-shift OOD problems are well-studied, this work focuses on covariate shifts - subtle variations in the data distribution that can degrade machine learning performance. We hypothesize that detecting these subtle shifts can improve our understanding of in-distribution boundaries, ultimately improving OOD detection. In adversarial discriminators trained with Batch Normalization (BN), real and adversarial samples form distinct domains with unique batch statistics - a property we exploit for OOD detection. We introduce DisCoPatch, an unsupervised Adversarial Variational Autoencoder (VAE) framework that harnesses this mechanism. During inference, batches consist of patches from the same image, ensuring a consistent data distribution that allows the model to rely on batch statistics. DisCoPatch uses the VAE's suboptimal outputs (generated and reconstructed) as negative samples to train the discriminator, thereby improving its ability to delineate the boundary between in-distribution samples and covariate shifts. By tightening this boundary, DisCoPatch achieves state-of-the-art results in public OOD detection benchmarks. The proposed model not only excels in detecting covariate shifts, achieving 95.5% AUROC on ImageNet-1K(-C) but also outperforms all prior methods on public Near-OOD (95.0%) benchmarks. With a compact model size of 25MB, it achieves high OOD detection performance at notably lower latency than existing methods, making it an efficient and practical solution for real-world OOD detection applications.

        "summary": "arXiv:2501.13358v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: First-price auctions have recently gained significant traction in digital advertising markets, exemplified by Google's transition from second-price to first-price auctions. Unlike in second-price auctions, where bidding one's private valuation is a dominant strategy, determining an optimal bidding strategy in first-price auctions is more complex. From a learning perspective, the learner (a specific bidder) can interact with the environment (other bidders, i.e., opponents) sequentially to infer their behaviors. Existing research often assumes specific environmental conditions and benchmarks performance against the best fixed policy (static benchmark). While this approach ensures strong learning guarantees, the static benchmark can deviate significantly from the optimal strategy in environments with even mild non-stationarity. To address such scenarios, a dynamic benchmark--representing the sum of the highest achievable rewards at each time step--offers a more suitable objective. However, achieving no-regret learning with respect to the dynamic benchmark requires additional constraints. By inspecting reward functions in online first-price auctions, we introduce two metrics to quantify the regularity of the sequence of opponents' highest bids, which serve as measures of non-stationarity. We provide a minimax-optimal characterization of the dynamic regret for the class of sequences of opponents' highest bids that satisfy either of these regularity constraints. Our main technical tool is the Optimistic Mirror Descent (OMD) framework with a novel optimism configuration, which is well-suited for achieving minimax-optimal dynamic regret rates in this context. We then use synthetic datasets to validate our theoretical guarantees and demonstrate that our methods outperform existing ones."

While some efforts have aimed to unify motion-related tasks, these methods simply use different modalities as conditions to guide motion generation. Consequently, they lack editing capabilities, fine-grained control, and fail to facilitate knowledge sharing across tasks. To address these limitations and provide a versatile, unified framework capable of handling both human motion generation and editing, we introduce a novel paradigm: \\textbf{Motion-Condition-Motion}, which enables the unified formulation of diverse tasks with three concepts: source motion, condition, and target motion. Based on this paradigm, we propose a unified framework, \\textbf{MotionLab}, which incorporates rectified flows to learn the mapping from source motion to target motion, guided by the specified conditions. In MotionLab, we introduce the 1) MotionFlow Transformer to enhance conditional generation and editing without task-specific modules; 2) Aligned Rotational Position Encoding to guarantee the time synchronization between source motion and target motion; 3) Task Specified Instruction Modulation; and 4) Motion Curriculum Learning for effective multi-task learning and knowledge sharing across tasks.

Using Chinese as a case study, this paper evaluates the effectiveness of applying English resources to machine translated text, local language lexicons, multilingual language models, and large language models (LLMs) in measuring MFs in non-English texts. The results indicate that machine translation and local lexicon approaches are insufficient for complex moral assessments, frequently resulting in a substantial loss of cultural information. In contrast, multilingual models and LLMs demonstrate reliable cross-language performance with transfer learning, with LLMs excelling in terms of data efficiency. Importantly, this study also underscores the need for human-in-the-loop validation of automated MF assessment, as the most advanced models may overlook cultural nuances in cross-language measurements.

Existing works focus on learning a router for a fixed pool of LLMs. In this paper, we consider the problem of dynamic routing, where new, previously unobserved LLMs are available at test time. We propose UniRoute, a new approach to this problem that relies on representing each LLM as a feature vector, derived based on predictions on a set of representative prompts. Based on this, we detail two effective instantiations of UniRoute, relying on cluster-based routing and a learned cluster map respectively. We show that these are estimates of a theoretically optimal routing rule, and quantify their errors via an excess risk bound. Experiments on a range of public benchmarks show the effectiveness of UniRoute in routing amongst more than 30 unseen LLMs."

In this work, we propose an Unsupervised adversarial detection via Contrastive Auxiliary Networks (U-CAN) to uncover adversarial behavior within auxiliary feature representations, without the need for adversarial examples. U-CAN is embedded within selected intermediate layers of the target model. These auxiliary networks, comprising projection layers and ArcFace-based linear layers, refine feature representations to more effectively distinguish between benign and adversarial inputs.

Anomaly detection methods also fall into this scope and utilize diffusion models to generate or reconstruct normal samples when given arbitrary anomaly images. However, our study found that the diffusion model suffers from severe ``faithfulness hallucination'' and ``catastrophic forgetting'', which can't meet the unpredictable pattern increments. To mitigate the above problems, we propose a continual diffusion model that uses gradient projection to achieve stable continual learning. Gradient projection deploys a regularization on the model updating by modifying the gradient towards the direction protecting the learned knowledge. But as a double-edged sword, it also requires huge memory costs brought by the Markov process. Hence, we propose an iterative singular value decomposition method based on the transitive property of linear representation, which consumes tiny memory and incurs almost no performance loss. Finally, considering the risk of ``over-fitting'' to normal images of the diffusion model, we propose an anomaly-masked network to enhance the condition mechanism of the diffusion model.

Although Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), trained on large datasets, demonstrates strong perception potential in perception tasks, its inherent training paradigm prevents it from being suitable for RGB-T tasks. To address these challenges, we propose SHIFNet, a novel SAM2-driven Hybrid Interaction Paradigm that unlocks the potential of SAM2 with linguistic guidance for efficient RGB-Thermal perception. Our framework consists of two key components: (1) Semantic-Aware Cross-modal Fusion (SACF) module that dynamically balances modality contributions through text-guided affinity learning, overcoming SAM2's inherent RGB bias; (2) Heterogeneous Prompting Decoder (HPD) that enhances global semantic information through a semantic enhancement module and then combined with category embeddings to amplify cross-modal semantic consistency. With 32.27M trainable parameters, SHIFNet achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance on public benchmarks, reaching 89.8% on PST900 and 67.8% on FMB, respectively. The framework facilitates the adaptation of pre-trained large models to RGB-T segmentation tasks, effectively mitigating the high costs associated with data collection while endowing robotic systems with comprehensive perception capabilities.

Despite recent progress, these tasks are often addressed independently, with GS-based rendering methods struggling under diverse light conditions and failing to produce accurate surfaces, while GS-based reconstruction methods frequently compromise rendering quality. This raises a central question: must rendering and reconstruction always involve a trade-off? To address this, we propose MGSR, a 2D/3D Mutual-boosted Gaussian splatting for Surface Reconstruction that enhances both rendering quality and 3D reconstruction accuracy. MGSR introduces two branches--one based on 2D-GS and the other on 3D-GS. The 2D-GS branch excels in surface reconstruction, providing precise geometry information to the 3D-GS branch. Leveraging this geometry, the 3D-GS branch employs a geometry-guided illumination decomposition module that captures reflected and transmitted components, enabling realistic rendering under varied light conditions. Using the transmitted component as supervision, the 2D-GS branch also achieves high-fidelity surface reconstruction. Throughout the optimization process, the 2D-GS and 3D-GS branches undergo alternating optimization, providing mutual supervision. Prior to this, each branch completes an independent warm-up phase, with an early stopping strategy implemented to reduce computational costs. We evaluate MGSR on a diverse set of synthetic and real-world datasets, at both object and scene levels, demonstrating strong performance in rendering and surface reconstruction.

We present DOFA-CLIP (Dynamic-One-For-All CLIP), a unified vision-language foundation model that dynamically adapts to EO modalities with flexible spectral configurations through a single Transformer backbone. Our approach introduces three key contributions: 1) the construction of GeoLangBind-2M, a large-scale EO image-text dataset covering six heterogeneous modalities with rich natural language descriptions; 2) a novel training strategy called VECT (Vision-models Enhanced Contrastive Text-image pretraining), which enhances the spatial awareness of CLIP features with multiple vision foundation models; and 3) a Modality-aware Knowledge Agglomeration (MaKA) module that refines feature distillation with modality-specific awareness. DOFA-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance across a wide range of EO benchmarks, including unseen modalities and a diverse number of input spectral bands.

The target style distribution is estimated from off-the-shelf style-dependent LoRAs via carefully designed score functions. To preserve content information adaptively, we propose Progressive Spectrum Regularization, which operates in the frequency domain to guide stylization progressively from low-frequency layouts to high-frequency details. In addition, we devise a Semantic-Aware Gradient Refinement technique that leverages relevance maps derived from diffusion semantic priors to selectively stylize semantically important regions. The proposed optimization formulation extends stylization from pixel space to parameter space, readily applicable to lightweight feedforward generators for efficient one-step stylization. SMS effectively balances style alignment and content preservation, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches, verified by extensive experiments."

In this paper, we investigate the training dynamics of infinitely wide, $L$-layer neural networks using the tensor program (TP) framework. Specifically, we show that, when trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) under the Maximal Update parametrization ($\\mu$P) and mild conditions on the activation function, SGD enables these networks to learn linearly independent features that substantially deviate from their initial values. This rich feature space captures relevant data information and ensures that any convergent point of the training process is a global minimum. Our analysis leverages both the interactions among features across layers and the properties of Gaussian random variables, providing new insights into deep representation learning. We further validate our theoretical findings through experiments on real-world datasets."

Traditional optimization-based approaches use multi-stage pipelines that are sensitive to pose initialization, while recent learning-based methods often struggle with generalization across diverse poses and garment types. We propose Equivariant Tightness Fitting for Clothed Humans, or ETCH, a novel pipeline that estimates cloth-to-body surface mapping through locally approximate SE(3) equivariance, encoding tightness as displacement vectors from the cloth surface to the underlying body. Following this mapping, pose-invariant body features regress sparse body markers, simplifying clothed human fitting into an inner-body marker fitting task. Extensive experiments on CAPE and 4D-Dress show that ETCH significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods -- both tightness-agnostic and tightness-aware -- in body fitting accuracy on loose clothing (16.7% ~ 69.5%) and shape accuracy (average 49.9%). Our equivariant tightness design can even reduce directional errors by (67.2% ~ 89.8%) in one-shot (or out-of-distribution) settings (~ 1% data). Qualitative results demonstrate strong generalization of ETCH, regardless of challenging poses, unseen shapes, loose clothing, and non-rigid dynamics.

We use a state-of-the-art LLM's recollection of each key moment to generate questions in similar situations, the decisions made by the agent, and alternative decisions it could have made (good or bad). We then measure an approximation of how well models align with human values on a set of human-voted answers. We also generate rules that can be automatically improved via an amendment process in order to generate the first Sci-Fi inspired constitutions for promoting ethical behavior in AIs and robots in the real world. Our first finding is that modern LLMs paired with constitutions turn out to be well-aligned with human values (95.8%), contrary to unsettling decisions typically made in Sci-Fi (only 21.2% alignment). Secondly, we find that generated constitutions substantially increase alignment compared to the base model (79.4% to 95.8%), and show resilience to an adversarial prompt setting (23.3% to 92.3%). Additionally, we find that those constitutions are among the top performers on the ASIMOV Benchmark which is derived from real-world images and hospital injury reports. Sci-Fi-inspired constitutions are thus highly aligned and applicable in real-world situations. We release SciFi-Benchmark: a large-scale dataset to advance robot ethics and safety research.

To address this, we introduce FiVE, a Fine-grained Video Editing Benchmark for evaluating emerging diffusion and rectified flow models.

To further enhance object-level evaluation, we introduce FiVE-Acc, a novel metric leveraging Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to assess the success of fine-grained video editing.

Previous works treat the recovery of these two visual quantities as separate tasks, which does not fit with the above-mentioned nature of event cameras and overlooks the inherent relations between them. We propose an unsupervised learning framework that jointly estimates optical flow (motion) and image intensity (appearance) using a single network. From the data generation model, we newly derive the event-based photometric error as a function of optical flow and image intensity. This error is further combined with the contrast maximization framework to form a comprehensive loss function that provides proper constraints for both flow and intensity estimation. Exhaustive experiments show our method's state-of-the-art performance: in optical flow estimation, it reduces EPE by 20% and AE by 25% compared to unsupervised approaches, while delivering competitive intensity estimation results, particularly in high dynamic range scenarios.

The resilience of deep neural networks (DNNs) to these errors depends not only on target device technology but also on model structure and the numerical representation and arithmetic precision of their parameters. Compression techniques like pruning and quantization, used to reduce memory footprint and computational complexity, alter both model structure and representation, affecting soft error robustness. In this regard, although often overlooked, the choice of activation functions (AFs) impacts not only accuracy and trainability but also compressibility and error resilience.

In the context of opinion dynamics, traditional models relied on static snapshots or assumed homogeneous agent behavior, overlooking how diverse cognitive dispositions shape belief evolution. While some recent models introduce behavioral heterogeneity, they typically focus on macro-level patterns, neglecting the unequal and individualized dynamics that unfold at the agent level. In this study, we analyze an adaptive social network model where each agent exhibits one of three behavioral tendencies-homophily, neophily (attention to novelty), or social conformity-and measure the complexity of individual opinion trajectories using normalized Lempel-Ziv (nLZ) complexity. We find that the resulting dynamics are often counterintuitive-homophilic agents, despite seeking similarity, become increasingly unpredictable; neophilic agents, despite pursuing novelty, stabilize; and conformic agents follow a U-shaped trajectory, transitioning from early stability to later unpredictability. More fundamentally, these patterns remain robust across diverse network settings, showing that internal behavioral dispositions - not external environment - primarily govern long-term opinion unpredictability. The broader implication is that individuals' experiences of ideological volatility, uncertainty, or stability are not merely environmental, but endogenously self-structured through their own cognitive tendencies. These results establish a novel individual-level lens on opinion dynamics, where the behavioral identity of agents serves as a dynamical fingerprint in the evolution of belief systems, and gives rise to persistent disparities in dynamical experience within self-organizing social systems, even in structurally similar environments."

However, the evaluation of code-assisted LLMs is generally restricted to execution correctness, lacking a rigorous evaluation of their generated programs. In this work, we bridge this gap by conducting an in-depth analysis of code-assisted LLMs generated programs in response to math reasoning tasks, with a focus on evaluating the soundness of the underlying reasoning processes. For this purpose, we assess the generations of five LLMs, on several math datasets, both manually and automatically, and propose a taxonomy of generated programs based on their logical soundness. Our findings show that the capabilities of models significantly impact the logic implemented to solve the problem. Closed-source LLMs ground their programs in mathematical concepts, whereas open-source models often resort to unsound reasoning, relying on memorized information and exhaustive searches. Furthermore, increasing the difficulty of problems decreases sound generations for all models, revealing a critical shortcoming of LLMs on complex mathematics, contrary to what accuracy metrics suggest. Our work highlights the need for more holistic evaluations of code-assisted LLMs beyond execution accuracy metrics, toward a better understanding of LLMs' limits in the math domain."

We propose a novel Generative Sign-description Prompts Multi-positive Contrastive learning (GSP-MC) method that leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with domain-specific LLMs, incorporating multi-step prompt engineering and expert-validated sign language corpora to produce precise multipart descriptions. The GSP-MC method also employs a dual-encoder architecture to bidirectionally align hierarchical skeleton features with multiple text descriptions (global, synonym, and part level) through probabilistic matching. Our approach combines global and part-level losses, optimizing KL divergence to ensure robust alignment across all relevant text-skeleton pairs while capturing both sign-level semantics and detailed part dynamics.

In particular, learned pullback geometry has recently undergone transformative developments that now make it scalable to learn and scalable to evaluate, which further opens the door for principled non-linear data analysis and interpretable machine learning.

The core difficulty is that no existing opinion prediction benchmark, particularly in a poll-based setting, compels a Large Language Model (LLM) to integrate all three capabilities, leaving a critical gap in our ability to evaluate genuine social understanding. Drawing from cognitive science principles, we introduce MindVote, the first benchmark evaluating poll prediction within naturalistic social media discourse. We construct MindVote from 3,918 authentic polls across Reddit and Weibo, incorporating rich contextual metadata that traditional survey-based benchmarks ignored. Our evaluation reveals three theoretical phenomena that validate cognitive science hypotheses: formal discourse privilege, where models achieve higher performance on institutional than on vernacular discourse; semantic space colonization, demonstrating performance biases favoring English content beyond translation artifacts; and contextual scaffolding dependencies, with performance degradation when social context is removed. These findings expose limitations in models, close the gaps of current opinion prediction benchmarks and advocate for developing socially-grounded AI systems with authentic cross-cultural opinion prediction.

The framework applies a white-box adversarial attack to align the output probability of a specific class to a designated value.

In this paper, we propose \\textbf{IOHFuseLM}, a multimodal language model framework. To accurately identify and differentiate sparse hypotensive events, we leverage a two-stage training strategy. The first stage involves domain adaptive pretraining on IOH physiological time series augmented through diffusion methods, thereby enhancing the model sensitivity to patterns associated with hypotension. Subsequently, task fine-tuning is performed on the original clinical dataset to further enhance the ability to distinguish normotensive from hypotensive states. To enable multimodal fusion for each patient, we align structured clinical descriptions with the corresponding physiological time series at the token level. Such alignment enables the model to capture individualized temporal patterns alongside their corresponding clinical semantics. In addition, we convert static patient attributes into structured text to enrich personalized information. Experimental evaluations on two intraoperative datasets demonstrate that IOHFuseLM outperforms established baselines in accurately identifying IOH events, highlighting its applicability in clinical decision support scenarios.

Our approach features an accumulated reward function that aggregates rewards across the entire trajectory and a fine-grained reward better suited to multi-turn correction scenarios.

Adolescent depression presents a significant challenge and is often comorbid with multiple disorders, such as suicidal ideation and sleep disturbances. This presents an additional opportunity to integrate multi-task learning (MTL) into our study by simultaneously predicting depression, suicidal ideation, and sleep disturbances using the multimodal formulation. We also propose a longitudinal analysis strategy that models temporal changes across multiple clinical interactions, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the conditions' progression. Our proposed approach, featuring trimodal, longitudinal MTL is evaluated on the Depression Early Warning dataset.

Specifically, our method employs a two-stage training strategy: firstly, independently training soft-pruning networks for different agent quantities to determine optimal agent-quantity-specific complete graphs and positional masks across specific tasks; and then jointly optimizing hard-pruning and soft-pruning within a maximum complete graph to dynamically configure the number of agents and their communication topologies per task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach is: (1) High-performing, achieving state-of-the-art results across six benchmarks and consistently generalizes across multiple mainstream LLM architectures, with a increase in performance of $2.58\\%\\sim 9.84\\%$; (2) Task-adaptive, dynamically constructing optimized communication topologies tailored to specific tasks, with an extremely high performance in all three task categories (general reasoning, mathematical reasoning, and code generation); (3) Token-economical, having fewer training steps and token consumption at the same time, with a decrease in token consumption of $90\\%+$; and (4) Training-efficient, achieving high performance with very few training steps compared with other methods. The performance will surpass the existing baselines after about ten steps of training under six benchmarks."

We investigate this problem from the perspective of competition-level programming (CP) programs and propose TCGBench, a Benchmark for (LLM generation of) Test Case Generators. This benchmark comprises two tasks, aimed at studying the capabilities of LLMs in (1) generating valid test case generators for a given CP problem, and further (2) generating targeted test case generators that expose bugs in human-written code. Experimental results indicate that while state-of-the-art LLMs can generate valid test case generators in most cases, most LLMs struggle to generate targeted test cases that reveal flaws in human code effectively. Especially, even advanced reasoning models (e.g., o3-mini) fall significantly short of human performance in the task of generating targeted generators. Furthermore, we construct a high-quality, manually curated dataset of instructions for generating targeted generators.

Current approaches struggle in this regard, as they require fixed, well-defined modelling environments, and they cannot adapt to novel variables without re-designs, or incorporate new information without re-training. To address this, we frame digital twinning as an in-context learning problem using large language models, enabling seamless updates to the twin at inference time.

However, the assumption of unconfoundedness may not hold for a fixed outcome in practice. To address this foundational limitation, we directly optimize the outcome definition to maximize causal identifiability. Our DEBIAS (Durable Effects with Backdoor-Invariant Aggregated Symptoms) algorithm learns non-negative, clinically interpretable weights for outcome aggregation, maximizing durable treatment effects and empirically minimizing both observed and latent confounding by leveraging the time-limited direct effects of prior treatments in psychiatric longitudinal data. The algorithm also furnishes an empirically verifiable test for outcome unconfoundedness. DEBIAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recovering causal effects for clinically interpretable composite outcomes across comprehensive experiments in depression and schizophrenia."

While existing studies primarily attribute the over-smoothing to repeated applications of graph Laplacian operators, our empirical analysis reveals a critical yet overlooked factor: trainable linear transformations in GCNs significantly exacerbate feature collapse, even at moderate depths (e.g., 8 layers). In contrast, Simplified Graph Convolution (SGC), which removes these transformations, maintains stable feature diversity up to 32 layers, highlighting linear transformations' dual role in facilitating expressive power and inducing over-smoothing. However, completely removing linear transformations weakens the model's expressive capacity. To address this trade-off, we propose Layer-wise Gradual Training (LGT), a novel training strategy that progressively builds deep GCNs while preserving their expressiveness. LGT integrates three complementary components: (1) layer-wise training to stabilize optimization from shallow to deep layers, (2) low-rank adaptation to fine-tune shallow layers and accelerate training, and (3) identity initialization to ensure smooth integration of new layers and accelerate convergence. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that LGT achieves state-of-the-art performance on vanilla GCN, significantly improving accuracy even in 32-layer settings. Moreover, as a training method, LGT can be seamlessly combined with existing methods such as PairNorm and ContraNorm, further enhancing their performance in deeper networks. LGT offers a general, architecture-agnostic training framework for scalable deep GCNs. The code is available at [https://github.com/jfklasdfj/LGT_GCN]."

Current 3D visual grounding (3DVG) methods treat text instructions with multiple steps as a whole, without extracting useful temporal information from each step. However, the instructions in SG3D often contain pronouns such as \"it\", \"here\" and \"the same\" to make language expressions concise. This requires grounding methods to understand the context and retrieve relevant information from previous steps to correctly locate object sequences. Due to the lack of an effective module for collecting related historical information, state-of-the-art 3DVG methods face significant challenges in adapting to the SG3D task. To fill this gap, we propose GroundFlow -- a plug-in module for temporal reasoning on 3D point cloud sequential grounding. Firstly, we demonstrate that integrating GroundFlow improves the task accuracy of 3DVG baseline methods by a large margin (+7.5\\% and +10.2\\%) in the SG3D benchmark, even outperforming a 3D large language model pre-trained on various datasets. Furthermore, we selectively extract both short-term and long-term step information based on its relevance to the current instruction, enabling GroundFlow to take a comprehensive view of historical information and maintain its temporal understanding advantage as step counts increase. Overall, our work introduces temporal reasoning capabilities to existing 3DVG models and achieves state-of-the-art performance in the SG3D benchmark across five datasets."

Contrasting with existing two-stage methods that follow a sequential ``edge point cloud reconstruction and parametric curve fitting'' pipeline, our one-stage approach optimizes 3D parametric curves directly from 2D edge maps, eliminating error accumulation caused by the inherent optimization gap between disconnected stages. However, parametric curves inherently lack suitability for rendering-based multi-view optimization, necessitating a complementary representation that preserves their geometric properties while enabling differentiable rendering. We propose a novel bi-directional coupling mechanism between parametric curves and edge-oriented Gaussian components. This tight correspondence formulates a curve-aware Gaussian representation, \\textbf{CurveGaussian}, that enables differentiable rendering of 3D curves, allowing direct optimization guided by multi-view evidence. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamically adaptive topology optimization framework during training to refine curve structures through linearization, merging, splitting, and pruning operations. Comprehensive evaluations on the ABC dataset and real-world benchmarks demonstrate our one-stage method's superiority over two-stage alternatives, particularly in producing cleaner and more robust reconstructions. Additionally, by directly optimizing parametric curves, our method significantly reduces the parameter count during training, achieving both higher efficiency and superior performance compared to existing approaches."

This task has traditionally been framed as a template matching problem, evolving through major phases including correlation filters, two-stream networks, and one-stream networks with significant progress achieved. However, these methods typically require explicit classification and regression modeling, depend on supervised training with large-scale datasets, and are limited to the single task of tracking, lacking flexibility. In recent years, multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly. Open-source models like Qwen2.5-VL, a flagship MLLMs with strong foundational capabilities, demonstrate excellent performance in grounding tasks. This has spurred interest in applying such models directly to visual tracking. However, experiments reveal that Qwen2.5-VL struggles with template matching between image pairs (i.e., tracking tasks). Inspired by deepseek-R1, we fine-tuned Qwen2.5-VL using the group relative policy optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning method on a small-scale dataset with a rule-based reward function. The resulting model, R1-Track, achieved notable performance on the GOT-10k benchmark. R1-Track supports flexible initialization via bounding boxes or text descriptions while retaining most of the original model's general capabilities.

To address this critical issue, we propose a unified, probability-agnostic, and adaptive framework, namely, CP-uniGuard, which is a tailored defense mechanism for CP deployed by each agent to accurately detect and eliminate malicious agents in its collaboration network. Our key idea is to enable CP to reach a consensus rather than a conflict against an ego agent's perception results. Based on this idea, we first develop a probability-agnostic sample consensus (PASAC) method to effectively sample a subset of the collaborators and verify the consensus without prior probabilities of malicious agents. Furthermore, we define collaborative consistency loss (CCLoss) for object detection task and bird's eye view (BEV) segmentation task to capture the discrepancy between an ego agent and its collaborators, which is used as a verification criterion for consensus.

Rapid and non-invasive spectral data were attained by a portable NIRS, recording absorbance data within the wavelength range of 700 to 1100 nm. A total of 40 Longissimus lumborum samples, evenly split between HNB and HLB, were obtained from a local hypermarket. Data analysis using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) demonstrated distinct spectral patterns associated with chemical changes, clearly separating the two beef varieties and accounting for 93.72% of the total variance. ML models, including Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest, Gradient Boosting (GB), K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree (DT), Naive Bayes (NB), and Neural Networks (NN), were implemented, optimized through hyperparameter tuning, and validated by 5-fold cross-validation techniques to enhance model robustness and prevent overfitting. Random Forest provided the highest predictive accuracy with a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.8826, closely followed by the SVM model at 0.8747. Furthermore, GB and NN algorithms exhibited satisfactory performances, with cross-validation scores of 0.752. Notably, the NN model achieved the highest recall rate of 0.7804, highlighting its suitability in scenarios requiring heightened sensitivity. DT and NB exhibited comparatively lower predictive performance. The LR and SVM models emerged as optimal choices by effectively balancing high accuracy, precision, and recall. This study confirms that integrating NIRS with ML techniques offers a powerful and reliable method for meat authenticity, significantly contributing to detecting food fraud."

        "summary": "arXiv:2507.04107v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: In this paper, we present a high-performing solution to the UAVM 2025 Challenge, which focuses on matching narrow FOV street-level images to corresponding satellite imagery using the University-1652 dataset. As panoramic Cross-View Geo-Localisation nears peak performance, it becomes increasingly important to explore more practical problem formulations. Real-world scenarios rarely offer panoramic street-level queries; instead, queries typically consist of limited-FOV images captured with unknown camera parameters. Our work prioritises discovering the highest achievable performance under these constraints, pushing the limits of existing architectures. Our method begins by retrieving candidate satellite image embeddings for a given query, followed by a re-ranking stage that selectively enhances retrieval accuracy within the top candidates. This two-stage approach enables more precise matching, even under the significant viewpoint and scale variations inherent in the task. Through experimentation, we demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive results -specifically attaining R@1 and R@10 retrieval rates of \\topone\\% and \\topten\\% respectively. This underscores the potential of optimised retrieval and re-ranking strategies in advancing practical geo-localisation performance. Code is available at https://github.com/tavisshore/VICI."

        "summary": "arXiv:2507.04123v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: This paper presents Edge-based Mixture of Experts (MoE) Collaborative Computing (EMC2), an optimal computing system designed for autonomous vehicles (AVs) that simultaneously achieves low-latency and high-accuracy 3D object detection. Unlike conventional approaches, EMC2 incorporates a scenario-aware MoE architecture specifically optimized for edge platforms. By effectively fusing LiDAR and camera data, the system leverages the complementary strengths of sparse 3D point clouds and dense 2D images to generate robust multimodal representations. To enable this, EMC2 employs an adaptive multimodal data bridge that performs multi-scale preprocessing on sensor inputs, followed by a scenario-aware routing mechanism that dynamically dispatches features to dedicated expert models based on object visibility and distance. In addition, EMC2 integrates joint hardware-software optimizations, including hardware resource utilization optimization and computational graph simplification, to ensure efficient and real-time inference on resource-constrained edge devices. Experiments on open-source benchmarks clearly show the EMC2 advancements as an end-to-end system. On the KITTI dataset, it achieves an average accuracy improvement of 3.58% and a 159.06% inference speedup compared to 15 baseline methods on Jetson platforms, with similar performance gains on the nuScenes dataset, highlighting its capability to advance reliable, real-time 3D object detection tasks for AVs.

        "summary": "arXiv:2507.05056v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Hallucinations in large vision-language models (LVLMs) pose significant challenges for real-world applications, as LVLMs may generate responses that appear plausible yet remain inconsistent with the associated visual content. This issue rarely occurs in human cognition. We argue that this discrepancy arises from humans' ability to effectively leverage multimodal interaction information in data samples. Specifically, humans typically first gather multimodal information, analyze the interactions across modalities for understanding, and then express their understanding through language. Motivated by this observation, we conduct extensive experiments on popular LVLMs and obtained insights that surprisingly reveal human-like, though less pronounced, cognitive behavior of LVLMs on multimodal samples. Building on these findings, we further propose \\textbf{INTER}: \\textbf{Inter}action Guidance Sampling, a novel training-free algorithm that mitigate hallucinations without requiring additional data. Specifically, INTER explicitly guides LVLMs to effectively reapply their understanding of multimodal interaction information when generating responses, thereby reducing potential hallucinations. On six benchmarks including VQA and image captioning tasks, INTER achieves an average improvement of up to 3.4\\% on five LVLMs compared to the state-of-the-art decoding strategy. The code will be released when the paper is accepted."

Traditional MoE methods, such as the Switch Transformer, route experts independently within each layer. Our analysis reveals that routers in most layers make expert choices that are not strongly correlated with the choices of the routers in other layers. To increase the cooperation between experts in different layers and encourage greater specialization, we use a shared router across different MoE layers. We call this model Omni-router Transformer. Extensive experiments on a large-scale pseudo-labeled dataset and evaluations across 10 diverse, out-of-domain ASR benchmarks demonstrate that the Omni-router Transformer is able to achieve lower training loss and consistently outperform dense and Switch Transformer models, reducing average word error rates by 11.2% and 8.2%, respectively, while providing structured expert usage and improved robustness to diverse data."

We introduce Agent KB, a shared knowledge base that captures both high-level problem-solving strategies and detailed execution lessons, enabling knowledge transfer across agent frameworks. Agent KB implements a novel teacher-student dual-phase retrieval mechanism where student agents retrieve workflow-level patterns for strategic guidance while teacher agents identify execution-level patterns for refinement. This hierarchical approach enables agents to break out of limited reasoning pathways by incorporating diverse strategies from external sources. Evaluations on the GAIA benchmark demonstrate substantial performance gains, with Agent KB improving success rates by up to 6.06 percentage points overall under pass@1. For SWE-bench code repair tasks, our system significantly improved resolution rates, with o3-mini achieving an 8.67 percentage point gain (23 percent to 31.67 percent) in pass@1. Our ablation studies demonstrate that the refinement module proves most critical, with its removal causing a 3.85% drop on challenging Level 3 tasks, highlighting that effective knowledge transfer necessitates both strategic guidance and execution-level refinement."

Gemini 2.5 Pro is our most capable model yet, achieving SoTA performance on frontier coding and reasoning benchmarks. In addition to its incredible coding and reasoning skills, Gemini 2.5 Pro is a thinking model that excels at multimodal understanding and it is now able to process up to 3 hours of video content. Its unique combination of long context, multimodal and reasoning capabilities can be combined to unlock new agentic workflows. Gemini 2.5 Flash provides excellent reasoning abilities at a fraction of the compute and latency requirements and Gemini 2.0 Flash and Flash-Lite provide high performance at low latency and cost.

Most existing deep learning-based polyp segmentation methods adopt an Encoder-Decoder architecture, and some utilize multi-task frameworks that incorporate auxiliary tasks like classification to improve segmentation. However, these methods often need more labeled data and depend on task similarity, potentially limiting generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose CL-Polyp, a contrastive learning-enhanced polyp segmentation network. Our method uses contrastive learning to enhance the encoder's extraction of discriminative features by contrasting positive and negative sample pairs from polyp images. This self-supervised strategy improves visual representation without needing additional annotations. We also introduce two efficient, lightweight modules: the Modified Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (MASPP) module for improved multi-scale feature fusion, and the Channel Concatenate and Element Add (CA) module to merge low-level and upsampled features for {enhanced} boundary reconstruction. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets-Kvasir-SEG, CVC-ClinicDB, CVC-ColonDB, CVC-300, and ETIS-show that CL-Polyp consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, it enhances the IoU metric by 0.011 and 0.020 on the Kvasir-SEG and CVC-ClinicDB datasets, respectively, demonstrating its effectiveness in clinical polyp segmentation."

However, in many applications -- particularly in healthcare -- this static summary fails to capture the nuanced dynamics of treatment effects that vary with both dose and time. We propose a framework for modelling treatment effect trajectories as smooth surfaces over dose and time, enabling the extraction of clinically actionable insights such as onset time, peak effect, and duration of benefit. To ensure interpretability, robustness, and verifiability -- key requirements in high-stakes domains -- we adapt SemanticODE, a recent framework for interpretable trajectory modelling, to the causal setting where treatment effects are never directly observed. Our approach decouples the estimation of trajectory shape from the specification of clinically relevant properties (e.g., maxima, inflection points), supporting domain-informed priors, post-hoc editing, and transparent analysis. We show that our method yields accurate, interpretable, and editable models of treatment dynamics, facilitating both rigorous causal analysis and practical decision-making."

Existing unlearning methods tend to forget shallowly: phenomenon of an unlearned model pretend to forget by adjusting only the model response, while its internal representations retain information sufficiently to restore the forgotten data or behavior. We empirically confirm the widespread shallowness by reverting the forgetting effect of various unlearning methods via training-free performance recovery attack and gradient-inversion-based data reconstruction attack. To address this vulnerability fundamentally, we define a theoretical criterion of ``deep forgetting'' based on one-point-contraction of feature representations of data to forget. We also propose an efficient approximation algorithm, and use it to construct a novel general-purpose unlearning algorithm: One-Point-Contraction (OPC). Empirical evaluations on image classification unlearning benchmarks show that OPC achieves not only effective unlearning performance but also superior resilience against both performance recovery attack and gradient-inversion attack. The distinctive unlearning performance of OPC arises from the deep feature forgetting enforced by its theoretical foundation, and recaps the need for improved robustness of machine unlearning methods."

This limitation stems from the inherently domain-specific nature of anomaly detection, which hinders the applicability of existing VLMs in industrial scenarios that require precise, structured, and context-aware analysis. To address these challenges, we propose SAGE, a VLM-based framework that enhances anomaly reasoning through Self-Guided Fact Enhancement (SFE) and Entropy-aware Direct Preference Optimization (E-DPO). SFE integrates domain-specific knowledge into visual reasoning via fact extraction and fusion, while E-DPO aligns model outputs with expert preferences using entropy-aware optimization. Additionally, we introduce AD-PL, a preference-optimized dataset tailored for industrial anomaly reasoning, consisting of 28,415 question-answering instances with expert-ranked responses. To evaluate anomaly reasoning models, we develop Multiscale Logical Evaluation (MLE), a quantitative framework analyzing model logic and consistency. SAGE demonstrates superior performance on industrial anomaly datasets under zero-shot and one-shot settings. The code, model and dataset are available at https://github.com/amoreZgx1n/SAGE."

For better generalization, we train with two different base architectures and use a single- and a multiple-epoch approach while keeping the number of tokens constant. Using the Maximal Update Parametrization and smaller proxy models, we tune relevant hyperparameters separately for each combination of base architecture and optimizer. We found that while the results from all three optimizers were in approximately the same range, Sophia exhibited the lowest training and validation loss, Lion was fastest in terms of training GPU hours but AdamW led to the best downstream evaluation results."

However, their deployment in safety-critical settings is hindered by two key limitations: (i) sensitivity to prompt design, and (ii) a tendency to generate incorrect responses with high confidence. As clinicians may rely on a model's stated confidence to gauge the reliability of its predictions, it is especially important that when a model expresses high confidence, it is also highly accurate. We introduce Prompt4Trust, the first reinforcement learning (RL) framework for prompt augmentation targeting confidence calibration in MLLMs. A lightweight LLM is trained to produce context-aware auxiliary prompts that guide a downstream task MLLM to generate responses in which the expressed confidence more accurately reflects predictive accuracy. Unlike conventional calibration techniques, Prompt4Trust specifically prioritizes aspects of calibration most critical for safe and trustworthy clinical decision-making. Beyond improvements driven by this clinically motivated calibration objective, our proposed method also improves task accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art medical visual question answering (VQA) performance on the PMC-VQA benchmark, which is composed of multiple-choice questions spanning diverse medical imaging modalities. Moreover, our framework trained with a small downstream task MLLM showed promising zero-shot generalization to larger MLLMs in our experiments, suggesting the potential for scalable calibration without the associated computational costs. This work demonstrates the potential of automated yet human-aligned prompt engineering for improving the the trustworthiness of MLLMs in safety critical settings.

Recently, the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) framework has demonstrated remarkable advancements in both image and video segmentation. However, the inherent limitations of SAM2's greedy selection memory design are amplified by the unique properties of surgical videos-rapid instrument movement, frequent occlusion, and complex instrument-tissue interaction-resulting in diminished performance in the segmentation of complex, long videos. To address these challenges, we introduce Memory Augmented (MA)-SAM2, a training-free video object segmentation strategy, featuring novel context-aware and occlusion-resilient memory models. MA-SAM2 exhibits strong robustness against occlusions and interactions arising from complex instrument movements while maintaining accuracy in segmenting objects throughout videos. Employing a multi-target, single-loop, one-prompt inference further enhances the efficiency of the tracking process in multi-instrument videos. Without introducing any additional parameters or requiring further training, MA-SAM2 achieved performance improvements of 4.36% and 6.1% over SAM2 on the EndoVis2017 and EndoVis2018 datasets, respectively, demonstrating its potential for practical surgical applications."

However, processing this retained subset still dominates computational runtime, while reductions of epochs also remain a challenge. We propose two complementary methods to accelerate classification-oriented AMU. First, \\textbf{Blend}, a novel distribution-matching dataset condensation (DC), merges visually similar images with shared blend-weights to significantly reduce the retained set size. It operates with minimal pre-processing overhead and is orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art DC methods. Second, our loss-centric method, \\textbf{Accelerated-AMU (A-AMU)}, augments the unlearning objective to quicken convergence. A-AMU achieves this by combining a steepened primary loss to expedite forgetting with a novel, differentiable regularizer that matches the loss distributions of forgotten and in-distribution unseen data. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that this dual approach of data and loss-centric optimization dramatically reduces end-to-end unlearning latency across both single and multi-round scenarios, all while preserving model utility and privacy. To our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically tackle unlearning efficiency by jointly designing a specialized dataset condensation technique with a dedicated accelerated loss function.

While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promise in enhancing scene understanding and decision making in autonomous vehicles, there is currently no standardized benchmark to quantitatively evaluate their reasoning abilities in complex, safety-critical scenarios involving VRUs. To address this gap, we present VRU-Accident, a large-scale vision-language benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in high-risk traffic scenarios involving VRUs. VRU-Accident comprises 1K real-world dashcam accident videos, annotated with 6K multiple-choice question-answer pairs across six safety-critical categories (with 24K candidate options and 3.4K unique answer choices), as well as 1K dense scene descriptions. Unlike prior works, our benchmark focuses explicitly on VRU-vehicle accidents, providing rich, fine-grained annotations that capture both spatial-temporal dynamics and causal semantics of accidents. To assess the current landscape of MLLMs, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 17 state-of-the-art models on the multiple-choice VQA task and on the dense captioning task. Our findings reveal that while MLLMs perform reasonably well on visually grounded attributes, they face significant challenges in reasoning and describing accident causes, types, and preventability."

This work revisits the inductive biases in Geographically Neural Network Weighted Regression (GNNWR) and identifies limitations in current approaches for modeling spatial non-stationarity. While GNNWR extends traditional Geographically Weighted Regression by using neural networks to learn spatial weighting functions, existing implementations are often restricted by fixed distance-based schemes and limited inductive bias. We propose to generalize GNNWR by incorporating concepts from convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and transformers, introducing local receptive fields, sequential context, and self-attention into spatial regression. Through extensive benchmarking on synthetic spatial datasets with varying heterogeneity, noise, and sample sizes, we show that GNNWR outperforms classic methods in capturing nonlinear and complex spatial relationships. Our results also reveal that model performance depends strongly on data characteristics, with local models excelling in highly heterogeneous or small-sample scenarios, and global models performing better with larger, more homogeneous data. These findings highlight the importance of inductive bias in spatial modeling and suggest future directions, including learnable spatial weighting functions, hybrid neural architectures, and improved interpretability for models handling non-stationary spatial data."

In this work, we introduce the Temporal Graph Reasoning Benchmark (T-GRAB), a comprehensive set of synthetic tasks designed to systematically probe the capabilities of TGNNs to reason across time.

Among those which do, some require paired tuples of occluded and holistic sequences, which are impractical to collect in the real world. Further, these approaches work on occlusions but fail to retain performance on holistic inputs. To address these challenges, we propose RG-Gait, a method for residual correction for occluded gait recognition with holistic retention. We model the problem as a residual learning task, conceptualizing the occluded gait signature as a residual deviation from the holistic gait representation. Our proposed network adaptively integrates the learned residual, significantly improving performance on occluded gait sequences without compromising the holistic recognition accuracy. We evaluate our approach on the challenging Gait3D, GREW and BRIAR datasets and show that learning the residual can be an effective technique to tackle occluded gait recognition with holistic retention.

Traditional methods often rely on monomodal approaches, focusing on single types of interactions like co-retweets or co-hashtags, or consider multiple modalities independently of each other. However, these approaches may overlook the complex dynamics inherent in multimodal coordination. This study compares different ways of operationalizing the detection of multimodal coordinated behavior. It examines the trade-off between weakly and strongly integrated multimodal models, highlighting the balance between capturing broader coordination patterns and identifying tightly coordinated behavior. By comparing monomodal and multimodal approaches, we assess the unique contributions of different data modalities and explore how varying implementations of multimodality impact detection outcomes. Our findings reveal that not all the modalities provide distinct insights, but that with a multimodal approach we can get a more comprehensive understanding of coordination dynamics.

However, challenges such as over-smoothing and over-compression remain when handling large-scale and complex graph datasets, leading to a decline in clustering quality. Although the Graph Transformer architecture has mitigated some of these issues, its performance is still limited when processing heterogeneous graph data. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel deep clustering framework that comprising GCN, Autoencoder (AE), and Graph Transformer, termed the Tri-Learn Graph Fusion Network (Tri-GFN). This framework enhances the differentiation and consistency of global and local information through a unique tri-learning mechanism and feature fusion enhancement strategy. The framework integrates GCN, AE, and Graph Transformer modules. These components are meticulously fused by a triple-channel enhancement module, which maximizes the use of both node attributes and topological structures, ensuring robust clustering representation. The tri-learning mechanism allows mutual learning among these modules, while the feature fusion strategy enables the model to capture complex relationships, yielding highly discriminative representations for graph clustering. It surpasses many state-of-the-art methods, achieving an accuracy improvement of approximately 0.87% on the ACM dataset, 14.14 % on the Reuters dataset, and 7.58 % on the USPS dataset.

Our goals with this track were to stimulate research and to provide high-quality evaluation of the most promising systems.\n  Methods: We hosted the Plain Language Adaptation of Biomedical Abstracts (PLABA) track at the 2023 and 2024 Text Retrieval Conferences. Tasks included complete, sentence-level, rewriting of abstracts (Task 1) as well as identifying and replacing difficult terms (Task 2).

Automatic, reference-based metrics generally did not correlate well with manual judgments. In Task 2, systems struggled with identifying difficult terms and classifying how to replace them.

In this paper, we propose a novel pruning strategy to challenge this dominating effect of magnitude and provide fair chance to each filter to be pruned, by placing it on projective space. After that, we observe the gradient descent movement whether the filters move toward the origin or not, to measure how the filter is likely to be pruned. This measurement is used to construct PROscore, a novel importance score for IPPRO, a novel importance-based structured pruning with magnitude-indifference. Our evaluation results shows that the proposed importance criteria using the projective space achieves near-lossless pruning by reducing the performance drop in pruning, with promising performance after the finetuning.

Traditional manual systems, even when supported by Instant Video Replay (IVR), often suffer from latency, subjectivity, and inconsistent enforcement, undermining fairness and athlete trust. This paper introduces 'FST.ai' -- which is developed under the 'R3AL.ai' project, which serves as its Principal Investigator: r3al.ai -- a novel AI-powered framework designed to enhance officiating in Sport Taekwondo, particularly focusing on the complex task of real-time head kick detection and scoring. Leveraging computer vision, deep learning, and edge inference, the system automates the identification and classification of key actions, significantly reducing decision time from minutes to seconds while improving consistency and transparency. Importantly, the methodology is not limited to Taekwondo. The underlying framework -- based on pose estimation, motion classification, and impact analysis -- can be adapted to a wide range of sports requiring action detection, such as judo, karate, fencing, or even team sports like football and basketball, where foul recognition or performance tracking is critical. By addressing one of Taekwondo's most challenging scenarios -- head kick scoring -- we demonstrate the robustness, scalability, and sport-agnostic potential of 'FST.ai' to transform officiating standards across multiple disciplines."

To address these challenges, we introduce SoulDance, a high-precision music-dance paired dataset captured via professional motion capture systems, featuring meticulously annotated holistic dance movements. Building on this dataset, we propose SoulNet, a framework designed to generate music-aligned, kinematically coordinated holistic dance sequences. SoulNet consists of three principal components: (1) Hierarchical Residual Vector Quantization, which models complex, fine-grained motion dependencies across the body, hands, and face; (2) Music-Aligned Generative Model, which composes these hierarchical motion units into expressive and coordinated holistic dance; (3) Music-Motion Retrieval Module, a pre-trained cross-modal model that functions as a music-dance alignment prior, ensuring temporal synchronization and semantic coherence between generated dance and input music throughout the generation process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SoulNet significantly surpasses existing approaches in generating high-quality, music-coordinated, and well-aligned holistic 3D dance sequences."

GNNs have proven highly effective in various network-based learning applications and require some form of node features to function. However, their performance is heavily influenced by the expressiveness of these features. In social networks, node features are often unavailable due to privacy constraints or the absence of inherent attributes, making it challenging for GNNs to achieve optimal performance. To address this limitation, we propose two strategies for constructing expressive node features. First, we introduce average controllability along with other centrality metrics (denoted as NCT-EFA) as node-level metrics that capture critical aspects of network topology. Building on this, we develop a rank encoding method that transforms average controllability or any other graph-theoretic metric into a fixed-dimensional feature space, thereby improving feature representation. We conduct extensive numerical evaluations using six benchmark GNN models across four social network datasets to compare different node feature construction methods. Our results demonstrate that incorporating average controllability into the feature space significantly improves GNN performance. Moreover, the proposed rank encoding method outperforms traditional one-hot degree encoding, improving the ROC AUC from 68.7% to 73.9% using GraphSAGE on the GitHub Stargazers dataset, underscoring its effectiveness in generating expressive and efficient node representations."

However, traditional PNR systems face several challenges, including an overreliance on textual content, common neglect of short-term user interests, and significant privacy concerns due to centralized data storage. This paper addresses these issues by introducing a novel multimodal federated learning-based approach for news recommendation. First, it integrates both textual and visual features of news items using a multimodal model, enabling a more comprehensive representation of content. Second, it employs a time-aware model that balances users' long-term and short-term interests through multi-head self-attention networks, improving recommendation accuracy. Finally, to enhance privacy, a federated learning framework is implemented, enabling collaborative model training without sharing user data. The framework divides the recommendation model into a large server-maintained news model and a lightweight user model shared between the server and clients. The client requests news representations (vectors) and a user model from the central server, then computes gradients with user local data, and finally sends their locally computed gradients to the server for aggregation. The central server aggregates gradients to update the global user model and news model. The updated news model is further used to infer news representation by the server. To further safeguard user privacy, a secure aggregation algorithm based on Shamir's secret sharing is employed. Experiments on a real-world news dataset demonstrate strong performance compared to existing systems, representing a significant advancement in privacy-preserving personalized news recommendation."

To address these challenges, we present FedMultiEmo, a privacy-preserving framework that fuses two complementary modalities at the decision level: visual features extracted by a Convolutional Neural Network from facial images, and physiological cues (heart rate, electrodermal activity, and skin temperature) classified by a Random Forest. FedMultiEmo builds on three key elements: (1) a multimodal federated learning pipeline with majority-vote fusion, (2) an end-to-end edge-to-cloud prototype on Raspberry Pi clients and a Flower server, and (3) a personalized Federated Averaging scheme that weights client updates by local data volume. Evaluated on FER2013 and a custom physiological dataset, the federated Convolutional Neural Network attains 77% accuracy, the Random Forest 74%, and their fusion 87%, matching a centralized baseline while keeping all raw data local. The developed system converges in 18 rounds, with an average round time of 120 seconds and a per-client memory footprint below 200 MB.

Current reinforcement learning approaches use binary rewards that treat elements as hit-or-miss targets, creating sparse signals that ignore the continuous nature of spatial interactions. Motivated by human clicking behavior that naturally forms Gaussian distributions centered on target elements, we introduce GUI Gaussian Grounding Rewards (GUI-G$^2$), a principled reward framework that models GUI elements as continuous Gaussian distributions across the interface plane. GUI-G$^2$ incorporates two synergistic mechanisms: Gaussian point rewards model precise localization through exponentially decaying distributions centered on element centroids, while coverage rewards assess spatial alignment by measuring the overlap between predicted Gaussian distributions and target regions. To handle diverse element scales, we develop an adaptive variance mechanism that calibrates reward distributions based on element dimensions. This framework transforms GUI grounding from sparse binary classification to dense continuous optimization, where Gaussian distributions generate rich gradient signals that guide models toward optimal interaction positions. Extensive experiments across ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2, and ScreenSpot-Pro benchmarks demonstrate that GUI-G$^2$, substantially outperforms state-of-the-art method UI-TARS-72B, with the most significant improvement of 24.7% on ScreenSpot-Pro. Our analysis reveals that continuous modeling provides superior robustness to interface variations and enhanced generalization to unseen layouts, establishing a new paradigm for spatial reasoning in GUI interaction tasks."

Despite notable advances with recent efforts, current techniques still lag behind human capabilities in handling drastic visual variations, occlusions, and complex scene changes. This limitation arises from their reliance on appearance matching, neglecting the human-like conceptual understanding of objects that enables robust identification across temporal dynamics. Motivated by this gap, we propose Segment Concept (SeC), a concept-driven segmentation framework that shifts from conventional feature matching to the progressive construction and utilization of high-level, object-centric representations. SeC employs Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to integrate visual cues across diverse frames, constructing robust conceptual priors. During inference, SeC forms a comprehensive semantic representation of the target based on processed frames, realizing robust segmentation of follow-up frames. Furthermore, SeC adaptively balances LVLM-based semantic reasoning with enhanced feature matching, dynamically adjusting computational efforts based on scene complexity. To rigorously assess VOS methods in scenarios demanding high-level conceptual reasoning and robust semantic understanding, we introduce the Semantic Complex Scenarios Video Object Segmentation benchmark (SeCVOS). SeCVOS comprises 160 manually annotated multi-scenario videos designed to challenge models with substantial appearance variations and dynamic scene transformations. In particular, SeC achieves an 11.8-point improvement over SAM 2.1 on SeCVOS, establishing a new state-of-the-art in concept-aware video object segmentation."

While artificial intelligence (AI)-based automated SRC diagnosis has gained increasing attention for its potential to enhance diagnostic efficiency and accuracy, existing methodologies lack systematic review. This gap impedes the assessment of disparities between algorithmic capabilities and clinical applicability. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of AI-driven SRC analysis from 2008 through June 2025. We systematically summarize the biological characteristics of SRCs and challenges in their automated identification. Representative algorithms are analyzed and categorized as unimodal or multi-modal approaches. Unimodal algorithms, encompassing image, omics, and text data, are reviewed; image-based ones are further subdivided into classification, detection, segmentation, and foundation model tasks. Multi-modal algorithms integrate two or more data modalities (images, omics, and text). Finally, by evaluating current methodological performance against clinical assistance requirements, we discuss unresolved challenges and future research directions in SRC analysis. This survey aims to assist researchers, particularly those without medical backgrounds, in understanding the landscape of SRC analysis and the prospects for intelligent diagnosis, thereby accelerating the translation of computational algorithms into clinical practice."

But even with these advances, mathematically lossless image compression (MLLIC) ratios for natural images still fall short of the bandwidth and cost-effectiveness requirements of most practical imaging and vision systems at present and beyond. To overcome the performance barrier of MLLIC, we question the very necessity of MLLIC. Considering that all digital imaging sensors suffer from acquisition noises, why should we insist on mathematically lossless coding, i.e., wasting bits to preserve noises? Instead, we propose a new paradigm of joint denoising and compression called functionally lossless image compression (FLLIC), which performs lossless compression of optimally denoised images (the optimality may be task-specific). Although not literally lossless with respect to the noisy input, FLLIC aims to achieve the best possible reconstruction of the latent noise-free original image. Extensive experiments show that FLLIC achieves state-of-the-art performance in joint denoising and compression of noisy images and does so at a lower computational cost."

Applying traditional systems optimizations such as parallelism and pipelining in compound AI systems is difficult because each component has different constraints in terms of the granularity and type of data that it ingests. New data is often generated during intermediate computations, and text streams may be split into smaller, independent fragments (such as documents to sentences) which may then be re-aggregated at later parts of the computation. Due to this complexity, existing systems to serve compound AI queries do not fully take advantage of parallelism and pipelining opportunities. We present Alto, a framework that automatically optimizes execution of compound AI queries through streaming and parallelism. Bento introduces a new abstraction called nested ancestry, a metadata hierarchy that allows the system to correctly track partial outputs and aggregate data across the heterogeneous constraints of the components of compound AI applications. This metadata is automatically inferred from the programming model, allowing developers to express complex dataflow patterns without needing to reason manually about the details of routing and aggregation. Implementations of four applications in Alto outperform or match implementations in LangGraph, a popular existing AI programming framework. Alto implementations match or improve latency by between 10-30%."

With recent advancements in deep neural networks and parallel computing, deep learning-based medical image registration methods become competitive with their flexible modelling and fast inference capabilities. However, compared to traditional optimization-based registration methods, the speed advantage may come at the cost of registration performance at inference time. Besides, deep neural networks ideally demand large training datasets while optimization-based methods are training-free. To improve registration accuracy and data efficiency, we propose a novel image registration method, termed Recurrent Inference Image Registration (RIIR) network. RIIR is formulated as a meta-learning solver to the registration problem in an iterative manner. RIIR addresses the accuracy and data efficiency issues, by learning the update rule of optimization, with implicit regularization combined with explicit gradient input.\n  We evaluated RIIR extensively on brain MRI and quantitative cardiac MRI datasets, in terms of both registration accuracy and training data efficiency. Our experiments showed that RIIR outperformed a range of deep learning-based methods, even with only $5\\%$ of the training data, demonstrating high data efficiency. Key findings from our ablation studies highlighted the important added value of the hidden states introduced in the recurrent inference framework for meta-learning. Our proposed RIIR offers a highly data-efficient framework for deep learning-based medical image registration."

By leveraging techniques from random matrix theory and free probability, we provide sharp asymptotics for the in- and out-of-sample risks of ridge regression when the data points have arbitrary correlations. We demonstrate that in this setting, the generalized cross validation estimator (GCV) fails to correctly predict the out-of-sample risk. However, in the case where the noise residuals have the same correlations as the data points, one can modify the GCV to yield an efficiently-computable unbiased estimator that concentrates in the high-dimensional limit, which we dub CorrGCV. We further extend our asymptotic analysis to the case where the test point has nontrivial correlations with the training set, a setting often encountered in time series forecasting. Assuming knowledge of the correlation structure of the time series, this again yields an extension of the GCV estimator, and sharply characterizes the degree to which such test points yield an overly optimistic prediction of long-time risk. We validate the predictions of our theory across a variety of high dimensional data."

It is vital in agriculture, environment, and military applications such as RSTA (reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition) missions.

Recent advancements in LLMs offer a new paradigm by leveraging their superior natural language and code comprehension abilities.

We then propose a hybrid structure-semantics retrieval method that combines structural and semantic analysis to retrieve the most relevant rewrite evidences for effectively answering an online query. We next propose a step-by-step LLM rewrite method that iteratively leverages the retrieved evidences to select and arrange rewrite rules with self-reflection.

This paper presents a framework for achieving autonomous excavation using reinforcement learning (RL) through a rock excavation simulator. In the simulation, resolution can be defined by the particle size/number in the whole soil space. Fine-resolution simulations closely mimic real-world behavior but demand significant calculation time and challenging sample collection, while coarse-resolution simulations enable faster sample collection but deviate from real-world behavior. To combine the advantages of both resolutions, we explore using policies developed in coarse-resolution simulations for pre-training in fine-resolution simulations. To this end, we propose a novel policy learning framework called Progressive-Resolution Policy Distillation (PRPD), which progressively transfers policies through some middle-resolution simulations with conservative policy transfer to avoid domain gaps that could lead to policy transfer failure. Validation in a rock excavation simulator and nine real-world rock environments demonstrated that PRPD reduced sampling time to less than 1/7 while maintaining task success rates comparable to those achieved through policy learning in a fine-resolution simulation."

Switch-GPU hybrid HBDs such as TPUv4 take a middle-ground approach, but the fault explosion radius remains large at the cube level (e.g., 64 TPUs).\n  We propose InfiniteHBD, a novel transceiver-centric HBD architecture that unifies connectivity and dynamic switching at the transceiver level} using Optical Circuit Switching (OCS). By embedding OCS within each transceiver, InfiniteHBD achieves reconfigurable point-to-multipoint connectivity, allowing the topology to adapt to variable-size rings.

This heterogeneity may benefit policy pre-training, but can hinder robot performance when used with a final imitation learning objective.

Moreover, such unreliable or underrepresented strategies can be difficult even for people to discern, and sifting through demonstration datasets is time-consuming and costly. On the other hand, policy performance when trained on such demonstrations can reflect the reliability of different strategies. We thus propose for robots to self-curate based on online robot experience (Demo-SCORE). More specifically, we train and cross-validate a classifier to discern successful policy roll-outs from unsuccessful ones and use the classifier to filter heterogeneous demonstration datasets. Our experiments in simulation and the real world show that Demo-SCORE can effectively identify suboptimal demonstrations without manual curation. Notably, Demo-SCORE achieves over 15-35% higher absolute success rate in the resulting policy compared to the base policy trained with all original demonstrations."

We demonstrate control distillation - where control mechanisms like Concept Sliders and LoRAs trained on base models can be seamlessly transferred to distilled models and vice-versa, effectively distilling control without any retraining. This preservation of representational structure prompted our investigation into the mechanisms of sample-diversity collapse during distillation. To understand how distillation affects diversity, we utilize $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}_{0}$ visualization as an analysis and debugging tool to reveal how models predict final outputs at intermediate steps. Through $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}_{0}$ visualization, we identify generation artifacts, inconsistencies, and demonstrate that initial diffusion timesteps disproportionately determine output diversity, while later steps primarily refine details. Based on these insights, we introduce diversity distillation - a hybrid inference approach that strategically employs the base model for only the first critical timestep before transitioning to the efficient distilled model. Our experiments demonstrate that this simple modification not only restores the diversity capabilities from base to distilled models but surprisingly exceeds it, while maintaining nearly the computational efficiency of distilled inference, all without requiring additional training or model modifications.

Most of the existing approaches result in centralized optimal controllers with offline training processes. However, as the increasing demand of network resilience, the optimal controllers are further expected to be distributed, and are desirable to be trained in an online distributed fashion, which are also the main contributions of our work. To solve this problem, we first propose a GRNN-based distributed optimal control method, and we cast the problem as a self-supervised learning problem. Then, the distributed online training is achieved via distributed gradient computation, and inspired by the (consensus-based) distributed optimization idea, a distributed online training optimizer is designed. Furthermore, the local closed-loop stability of the linear networked system under our proposed GRNN-based controller is provided by assuming that the nonlinear activation function of the GRNN-based controller is both local sector-bounded and slope-restricted.

To deepen our understanding of their performance in real-world scenarios where the distributions of training and test data may differ, we conduct a rigorous investigation into the convergence behavior of spectral algorithms under covariate shift. In this setting, the marginal distributions of the input data differ between the training and test datasets, while the conditional distribution of the output given the input remains unchanged. Within a non-parametric regression framework over a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, we analyze the convergence rates of spectral algorithms under covariate shift and show that they achieve minimax optimality when the density ratios between the training and test distributions are uniformly bounded. However, when these density ratios are unbounded, the spectral algorithms may become suboptimal. To address this issue, we propose a novel weighted spectral algorithm with normalized weights that incorporates density ratio information into the learning process. Our theoretical analysis shows that this normalized weighted approach achieves optimal capacity-independent convergence rates, but the rates will suffer from the saturation phenomenon. Furthermore, by introducing a weight clipping technique, we demonstrate that the convergence rates of the weighted spectral algorithm with clipped weights can approach the optimal capacity-dependent convergence rates arbitrarily closely. This improvement resolves the suboptimality issue in unbounded density ratio scenarios and advances the state-of-the-art by refining existing theoretical results."

The current methods used to assess the characteristic lift and drag coefficients include Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), thin aerofoil and panel methods, all face trade-offs between computational speed and the accuracy of the results and as such NNs have been investigated as an alternative with the aim that it would perform both quickly and accurately. As such, this paper provides a benchmark for the windAI_bench dataset published by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in the USA. In order to validate the methodology of the benchmarking, the AirfRANSdataset benchmark is used as both a starting point and a point of comparison. This study evaluates four neural networks (MLP, PointNet, GraphSAGE, GUNet) trained on a range of aerofoils at 25 angles of attack (4$^\\circ$ to 20$^\\circ$) to predict fluid flow and calculate lift coefficients ($C_L$) via the panel method. GraphSAGE and GUNet performed well during the training phase, but underperformed during testing. Accordingly, this paper has identified PointNet and MLP as the two strongest models tested, however whilst the results from MLP are more commonly correct for predicting the behaviour of the fluid, the results from PointNet provide the more accurate results for calculating $C_L$."

This task requires simultaneous modeling of spatial information and dramatic prosody based on multimodal inputs, with high data collection costs. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first attempt to address these challenges. We construct MRSDrama, the first multimodal recorded spatial drama dataset, containing binaural drama audios, scripts, videos, geometric poses, and textual prompts. Then, we propose ISDrama, the first immersive spatial drama generation model through multimodal prompting. ISDrama comprises these primary components: 1) Multimodal Pose Encoder, based on contrastive learning, considering the Doppler effect caused by moving speakers to extract unified pose information from multimodal prompts. 2) Immersive Drama Transformer, a flow-based mamba-transformer model that generates high-quality drama, incorporating Drama-MOE to select proper experts for enhanced prosody and pose control. We also design a context-consistent classifier-free guidance strategy to coherently generate complete drama. Experimental results show that ISDrama outperforms baseline models on objective and subjective metrics. The demos are available at https://aaronz345.github.io/ISDramaDemo.

To address these challenges, this paper proposes a goal-oriented reinforcement learning-based path planning algorithm. This algorithm is the first to address the challenge that previous reinforcement learning methods failed to overcome, namely handling multiple target configurations. Moreover, techniques such as Hindsight Experience Replay and Invalid Action Masking are incorporated to overcome the significant obstacles posed by sparse rewards and invalid actions. Based on these designs, our model achieves a 95% and 73% success rate in reaching arbitrary target configurations in a modular satellite cluster composed of four and six units, respectively."

To overcome the challenge, we employ a hybrid deep learning model containing a graph neural network followed by a deep neural network. We estimate that such a state-of-the-art deep learning analysis pipeline can lead to a performance comparable to that in the semi-leptonic mode, taking the discovery (exclusion) reach up to about $M_B=1.8\\:(2.4)$ TeV at HL-LHC when $B$ decays fully exotically, i.e., BR$(B \\to b\\Phi) = 100\\%$."

This extensive dataset offers a unique opportunity to study their variability by combining multiple Gaia data products. In preparation for DR4, we propose and evaluate a machine learning methodology capable of ingesting multiple Gaia data products to achieve an unsupervised classification of stellar and quasar variability. A dataset of 4 million Gaia DR3 sources is used to train three variational autoencoders (VAE), which are artificial neural networks (ANNs) designed for data compression and generation. One VAE is trained on Gaia XP low-resolution spectra, another on a novel approach based on the distribution of magnitude differences in the Gaia G band, and the third on folded Gaia G band light curves. Each Gaia source is compressed into 15 numbers, representing the coordinates in a 15-dimensional latent space generated by combining the outputs of these three models. The learned latent representation produced by the ANN effectively distinguishes between the main variability classes present in Gaia DR3, as demonstrated through both supervised and unsupervised classification analysis of the latent space. The results highlight a strong synergy between light curves and low-resolution spectral data, emphasising the benefits of combining the different Gaia data products. A two-dimensional projection of the latent variables reveals numerous overdensities, most of which strongly correlate with astrophysical properties, showing the potential of this latent space for astrophysical discovery. We show that the properties of our novel latent representation make it highly valuable for variability analysis tasks, including classification, clustering and outlier detection."

Recently, large language models (LLMs), trained on large amounts of code, have shown significant promise in code generation and optimization tasks, but generating low-resource languages like specialized tensor accelerator code still poses a significant challenge. We tackle this challenge with Autocomp, an approach that empowers accelerator programmers to leverage domain knowledge and hardware feedback to optimize code via an automated LLM-driven search. We accomplish this by: 1) formulating each optimization pass as a structured two-phase prompt, divided into planning and code generation phases, 2) inserting domain knowledge during planning via a concise and adaptable optimization menu, and 3) integrating correctness and performance metrics from hardware as feedback at each search iteration. Across three categories of representative workloads and two different accelerators, we demonstrate that Autocomp-optimized code runs 5.6x (GEMM) and 2.7x (convolution) faster than the vendor-provided library, and outperforms expert-level hand-tuned code by 1.4x (GEMM), 1.1x (convolution), and 1.3x (fine-grained linear algebra). Additionally, we demonstrate that optimization schedules generated from Autocomp can be reused across similar tensor operations, improving speedups by up to 24% under a fixed sample budget."

Our approach uniquely integrates student narrative text with a teacher-derived, 9-dimensional \"Empathy Vector\" (EV), its dimensions guided by the PHQ-9 framework,to explicitly translate tacit empathetic insight into a structured AI input enhancing rather than replacing human judgment.

Here, we introduce the application of Quantum Cognition Machine Learning (QCML), a quantum-inspired computational framework, to estimate morphology-predicted chromosomal instability in CTCs from patients with metastatic breast cancer. QCML leverages quantum mechanical principles to represent data as state vectors in a Hilbert space, enabling context-aware feature modeling, dimensionality reduction, and enhanced generalization without requiring curated feature selection. QCML outperforms conventional machine learning methods when tested on out of sample verification CTCs, achieving higher accuracy in identifying predicted large-scale state transitions (pLST) status from CTC-derived morphology features. These preliminary findings support the application of QCML as a novel machine learning tool with superior performance in high-dimensional, low-sample-size biomedical contexts.

We propose a diffusion-based framework trained to model the normative distribution of clean ECG signals, identifying deviations as noise without requiring explicit artifact labels. To robustly evaluate performance and mitigate label inconsistencies, we introduce a distribution-based metric using the Wasserstein-1 distance ($W_1$). Our model achieved a macro-average $W_1$ score of 1.308, outperforming the next-best method by over 48\\%.

Inspired by the hierarchical and multi-timescale processing in the human brain, we propose the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM), a novel recurrent architecture that attains significant computational depth while maintaining both training stability and efficiency. HRM executes sequential reasoning tasks in a single forward pass without explicit supervision of the intermediate process, through two interdependent recurrent modules: a high-level module responsible for slow, abstract planning, and a low-level module handling rapid, detailed computations. With only 27 million parameters, HRM achieves exceptional performance on complex reasoning tasks using only 1000 training samples. The model operates without pre-training or CoT data, yet achieves nearly perfect performance on challenging tasks including complex Sudoku puzzles and optimal path finding in large mazes. Furthermore, HRM outperforms much larger models with significantly longer context windows on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), a key benchmark for measuring artificial general intelligence capabilities. These results underscore HRM's potential as a transformative advancement toward universal computation and general-purpose reasoning systems."

We adopt a category-theoretic approach to CP -- framing it as a morphism, embedded in a commuting diagram, of two newly-defined categories -- that brings us three joys. First, we show that -- under minimal assumptions -- CP is intrinsically a UQ mechanism, that is, its cardinal UQ capabilities are a structural feature of the method. Second, we demonstrate that CP bridges (and perhaps subsumes) the Bayesian, frequentist, and imprecise probabilistic approaches to predictive statistical reasoning. Finally, we show that a CPR is the image of a covariant functor. This observation is relevant to AI privacy: It implies that privacy noise added locally does not break the global coverage guarantee."

At each stop, where the platform maintains a fixed pose and the motors keep the cables under tension, the system must evaluate whether it is safe to proceed by detecting anomalies that could compromise performance (e.g., wind gusts or cable impacts). This paper investigates whether anomalies can be detected using only motor torque data, without additional sensors. It introduces an adaptive, unsupervised outlier detection algorithm based on Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to identify anomalies from torque signals. The method starts with a brief calibration period, just a few seconds, during which a GMM is fit on known anomaly-free data. Real-time torque measurements are then evaluated using Mahalanobis distance from the GMM, with statistically derived thresholds triggering anomaly flags. Model parameters are periodically updated using the latest segments identified as anomaly-free to adapt to changing conditions. Validation includes 14 long-duration test sessions simulating varied wind intensities. The proposed method achieves a 100% true positive rate and 95.4% average true negative rate, with 1-second detection latency. Comparative evaluation against power threshold and non-adaptive GMM methods indicates higher robustness to drift and environmental variation."

We propose a framework combining multi-granularity sparse activation with hierarchical knowledge graphs. Our approach employs four complementary matching algorithms with diversity control and a five-level fallback strategy for precise concept activation. A three-layer knowledge graph (taxonomy, clinical features, instances) provides structured, up-to-date context. Experiments on the BioASQ rare disease dataset demonstrate significant improvements: BLEU scores increased by up to 0.13, ROUGE by up to 0.10, and diagnostic accuracy by up to 0.25, with the best model achieving 0.92 accuracy--surpassing the 0.90 clinical threshold. Expert evaluation confirms enhancements in information quality, reasoning, and professional expression. Our framework shows promise in reducing the diagnostic odyssey for rare disease patients."

We argue that this profound adaptability is fundamentally linked to the efficient construction and refinement of internal representations of the environment, commonly referred to as world models, and we refer to this adaptation mechanism as world model induction. However, current understanding and evaluation of world models in artificial intelligence (AI) remains narrow, often focusing on static representations learned from training on massive corpora of data, instead of the efficiency and efficacy in learning these representations through interaction and exploration within a novel environment. In this Perspective, we provide a view of world model induction drawing on decades of research in cognitive science on how humans learn and adapt so efficiently; we then call for a new evaluation framework for assessing adaptive world models in AI. Concretely, we propose a new benchmarking paradigm based on suites of carefully designed games with genuine, deep and continually refreshing novelty in the underlying game structures -- we refer to this class of games as novel games. We detail key desiderata for constructing these games and propose appropriate metrics to explicitly challenge and evaluate the agent's ability for rapid world model induction. We hope that this new evaluation framework will inspire future evaluation efforts on world models in AI and provide a crucial step towards developing AI systems capable of human-like rapid adaptation and robust generalization -- a critical component of artificial general intelligence."

        "summary": "arXiv:2507.13179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: As 6G networks are developed and defined, offloading of XR applications is emerging as one of the strong new use cases. The reduced 6G latency coupled with edge processing infrastructure will for the first time provide a realistic offloading scenario in cellular networks where several computationally intensive functions, including rendering, can migrate from the user device and into the network. A key advantage of doing so is the lowering of the battery needs in the user devices and the possibility to design new devices with smaller form factors. However, offloading introduces increased delays compared to local execution, primarily due to network transmission latency and queuing delays at edge servers, especially under multi-user concurrency. Despite the computational power of edge platforms, the resulting motion-to-photon (MTP) latency negatively impacts user experience. To mitigate this, motion prediction has been proposed to offset delays. Existing approaches build on either deep learning or Kalman filtering. Deep learning techniques face scalability limitations at the resource-constrained edge, as their computational expense intensifies with increasing user concurrency, while Kalman filtering suffers from poor handling of complex movements and fragility to packet loss inherent in 6G's high-frequency radio interfaces. In this work, we introduce a context-aware error-state Kalman filter (ESKF) prediction framework, which forecasts the user's head motion trajectory to compensate for MTP latency in remote XR. By integrating a motion classifier that categorizes head motions based on their predictability, our algorithm demonstrates reduced prediction error across different motion classes. Our findings demonstrate that the optimized ESKF not only surpasses traditional Kalman filters in positional and orientational accuracy but also exhibits enhanced robustness and resilience to packet loss."

While recent advances in LLMs show promise for code generation, current SOTA models (e.g. R1, o1) achieve low success rates in improving CUDA speed. In this paper, we introduce CUDA-L1, an automated reinforcement learning framework for CUDA optimization.\n  CUDA-L1 achieves performance improvements on the CUDA optimization task: trained on NVIDIA A100, it delivers an average speedup of x17.7 across all 250 CUDA kernels of KernelBench, with peak speedups reaching x449. Furthermore, the model also demonstrates excellent portability across GPU architectures, achieving average speedups of x17.8 on H100, x19.0 on RTX 3090, x16.5 on L40, x14.7 on H800, and x13.9 on H20 despite being optimized specifically for A100. Beyond these benchmark results, CUDA-L1 demonstrates several remarkable properties: 1) Discovers a variety of CUDA optimization techniques and learns to combine them strategically to achieve optimal performance; 2) Uncovers fundamental principles of CUDA optimization; 3) Identifies non-obvious performance bottlenecks and rejects seemingly beneficial optimizations that harm performance.\n  The capabilities of CUDA-L1 demonstrate that reinforcement learning can transform an initially poor-performing LLM into an effective CUDA optimizer through speedup-based reward signals alone, without human expertise or domain knowledge. More importantly, the trained RL model extend the acquired reasoning abilities to new kernels. This paradigm opens possibilities for automated optimization of CUDA operations, and holds promise to substantially promote GPU efficiency and alleviate the rising pressure on GPU computing resources."

Consequently, the detection and localization of these interference signals are essential to achieve situational awareness, mitigating their impact, and implementing effective counter-measures. Classical Angle of Arrival (AoA) methods exhibit reduced accuracy in multipath environments due to signal reflections and scattering, leading to localization errors. Additionally, AoA-based techniques demand substantial computational resources for array signal processing. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for detecting and classifying interference while estimating the distance, azimuth, and elevation of jamming sources. Our benchmark study evaluates 128 vision encoder and time-series models to identify the highest-performing methods for each task. We introduce an attention-based fusion framework that integrates in-phase and quadrature (IQ) samples with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-computed spectrograms while incorporating 22 AoA features to enhance localization accuracy. Furthermore, we present a novel dataset of moving jamming devices recorded in an indoor environment with dynamic multipath conditions and demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods."

To address this, this paper introduces Routine, a multi-step agent planning framework designed with a clear structure, explicit instructions, and seamless parameter passing to guide the agent's execution module in performing multi-step tool-calling tasks with high stability. In evaluations conducted within a real-world enterprise scenario, Routine significantly increases the execution accuracy in model tool calls, increasing the performance of GPT-4o from 41.1% to 96.3%, and Qwen3-14B from 32.6% to 83.3%. We further constructed a Routine-following training dataset and fine-tuned Qwen3-14B, resulting in an accuracy increase to 88.2% on scenario-specific evaluations, indicating improved adherence to execution plans. In addition, we employed Routine-based distillation to create a scenario-specific, multi-step tool-calling dataset. Fine-tuning on this distilled dataset raised the model's accuracy to 95.5%, approaching GPT-4o's performance. These results highlight Routine's effectiveness in distilling domain-specific tool-usage patterns and enhancing model adaptability to new scenarios.

By endowing the open set with a Riemannian metric induced by a barrier function, we obtain a Riemannian subgradient flow formulated as a differential inclusion, which remains strictly within the interior of the feasible set. This continuous dynamical system unifies two classes of iterative optimization methods, namely the Hessian barrier method and mirror descent scheme, by revealing that these methods can be interpreted as discrete approximations of the continuous flow. We explore the long-term behavior of the trajectories generated by this dynamical system and show that the existing deficient convergence properties of the Hessian barrier and mirror descent scheme can be unifily and more insightfully interpreted through these of the continuous trajectory. For instance, the notorious spurious stationary points \\cite{chen2024spurious} observed in Hessian barrier method and mirror descent scheme are interpreted as stable equilibria of the dynamical system that do not correspond to real stationary points of the original optimization problem. We provide two sufficient condition such that these spurious stationary points can be avoided if the strict complementarity conditions holds. In the absence of these regularity condition, we propose a random perturbation strategy that ensures the trajectory converges (subsequentially) to an approximate stationary point. Building on these insights, we introduce two iterative Riemannian subgradient methods, form of interior point methods, that generalizes the existing Hessian barrier method and mirror descent scheme for solving nonsmooth nonconvex optimization problems."

To address this, we introduce EndoControlMag, a training-free, Lagrangian-based framework with mask-conditioned vascular motion magnification tailored to endoscopic environments. Our approach features two key modules: a Periodic Reference Resetting (PRR) scheme that divides videos into short overlapping clips with dynamically updated reference frames to prevent error accumulation while maintaining temporal coherence, and a Hierarchical Tissue-aware Magnification (HTM) framework with dual-mode mask dilation. HTM first tracks vessel cores using a pretrained visual tracking model to maintain accurate localization despite occlusions and view changes. It then applies one of two adaptive softening strategies to surrounding tissues: motion-based softening that modulates magnification strength proportional to observed tissue displacement, or distance-based exponential decay that simulates biomechanical force attenuation. This dual-mode approach accommodates diverse surgical scenarios-motion-based softening excels with complex tissue deformations while distance-based softening provides stability during unreliable optical flow conditions. We evaluate EndoControlMag on our EndoVMM24 dataset spanning four different surgery types and various challenging scenarios, including occlusions, instrument disturbance, view changes, and vessel deformations. Quantitative metrics, visual assessments, and expert surgeon evaluations demonstrate that EndoControlMag significantly outperforms existing methods in both magnification accuracy and visual quality while maintaining robustness across challenging surgical conditions.

We present Hierarchical Budget Policy Optimization (HBPO), a reinforcement learning framework that enables models to learn problem-specific reasoning depths without sacrificing capability. HBPO addresses the fundamental challenge of exploration space collapse in efficiency-oriented training, where penalties on long output length systematically bias models away from necessary long reasoning paths. Through hierarchical budget exploration, our approach partitions rollout samples into multiple subgroups with distinct token budgets, aiming to enable efficient resource allocation while preventing degradation of capability. We introduce differentiated reward mechanisms that create budget-aware incentives aligned with the complexity of the problem, allowing models to discover natural correspondences between task requirements and computational effort. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HBPO reduces average token usage by up to 60.6% while improving accuracy by 3.14% across four reasoning benchmarks. Unlike existing methods that impose external constraints or rely on discrete mode selection, HBPO exhibits emergent adaptive behavior where models automatically adjust reasoning depth based on problem complexity. Our results suggest that reasoning efficiency and capability are not inherently conflicting, and can be simultaneously optimized through appropriately structured hierarchical training that preserves exploration diversity."

This corpus was produced by the German musicologist Clemens Goldberg who encoded since 2010 onwards the musical content of 34 major 15th-c. music manuscripts and other complementary files, in order to offer on his foundation's website PDF files of complete collections of works by Du Fay, Binchois, Okeghem, Busnoys and most of their major contemporaries, focusing on their secular output. This corpus was encoded in an XML format named CMME (Computerized Mensural Music Editing), specifically conceived for mensural music by Theodor Dumitrescu in the 2000s, together with editorial and publication tools which have not been updated since then. This article focuses on the development of a set of conversion tools for these CMME files to meet more up-to-date standards of music encoding, namely MEI. A workshop was organised in September 2024 at the Campus Condorcet in Paris, gathering experts with a wide range of knowledge on mensural music notation, XML formats and programming. A converter was developped directly in the open-source rendering library Verovio, allowing the conversion from CMME to MEI mensural. A conversion to MEI CMN was implemented afterwards, enabling to load these files in common engraving softwares such as MuseScore with minimal loss of information. With the availability of a direct import of CMME-XML into Verovio, the corpus of existing CMME files gets a new life. Furthermore, since the stand-alone CMME editor still works fine and no alternative is available yet for native MEI, the converter offers a new pipeline for encoding and editing mensural music."

However, most existing approaches are designed for time-synchronized microphone setups, a condition that may not hold in real-world meeting scenarios, where time latency and clock drift vary across devices. Under such conditions, we found transform-average-concatenate (TAC), a popular module for neural multi-microphone processing, insufficient in handling time-asynchronous microphones. In response, we propose a windowed cross-attention module capable of dynamically aligning features between all microphones. This module is invariant to both the permutation and the number of microphones and can be easily integrated into existing models. Furthermore, we propose an optimal training target for multi-talker environments. We evaluated our approach in a multi-microphone noisy reverberant setup with unknown time latency and clock drift of each microphone. Experimental results show that our method outperforms TAC on both iFaSNet and CRUSE models, offering faster convergence and improved learning, demonstrating the efficacy of the windowed cross-attention module for asynchronous microphone setups."

This study introduces a synthetic data framework to generate large volumes of richly labelled training data from very limited source material, improving the robustness of bioacoustic detection models. Our framework synthesises realistic soundscapes by combining clean background noise with isolated target vocalisations (little owl), automatically generating dynamic labels like bounding boxes during synthesis. A model fine-tuned on this data generalised well to real-world soundscapes, with performance remaining high even when the diversity of source vocalisations was drastically reduced, indicating the model learned generalised features without overfitting. This demonstrates that synthetic data generation is a highly effective strategy for training robust bioacoustic detectors from small source datasets. The approach significantly reduces manual labelling effort, overcoming a key bottleneck in computational bioacoustics and enhancing ecological assessment capabilities."

        "summary": "arXiv:2507.16343v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Most existing sound event detection~(SED) algorithms operate under a closed-set assumption, restricting their detection capabilities to predefined classes. While recent efforts have explored language-driven zero-shot SED by exploiting audio-language models, their performance is still far from satisfactory due to the lack of fine-grained alignment and cross-modal feature fusion. In this work, we propose the Detect Any Sound Model (DASM), a query-based framework for open-vocabulary SED guided by multi-modal queries. DASM formulates SED as a frame-level retrieval task, where audio features are matched against query vectors derived from text or audio prompts. To support this formulation, DASM introduces a dual-stream decoder that explicitly decouples event recognition and temporal localization: a cross-modality event decoder performs query-feature fusion and determines the presence of sound events at the clip-level, while a context network models temporal dependencies for frame-level localization. Additionally, an inference-time attention masking strategy is proposed to leverage semantic relations between base and novel classes, substantially enhancing generalization to novel classes. Experiments on the AudioSet Strong dataset demonstrate that DASM effectively balances localization accuracy with generalization to novel classes, outperforming CLAP-based methods in open-vocabulary setting (+ 7.8 PSDS) and the baseline in the closed-set setting (+ 6.9 PSDS). Furthermore, in cross-dataset zero-shot evaluation on DESED, DASM achieves a PSDS1 score of 42.2, even exceeding the supervised CRNN baseline.

First, a pretrained large language model (LLM) segments the text into a structured format with time and spatial details for each sound event. Next, a pretrained mono audio generation network creates multiple mono audios with varying durations for each event. These mono audios are transformed into binaural audios using a binaural rendering neural network based on spatial data from the LLM. Finally, the binaural audios are arranged by their start times, resulting in multisource binaural audio. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of both audio generation quality and spatial perceptual accuracy."

However, since their representations are inherently black-box, it remains unclear what drives their alignment with brain responses. To remedy this, we built linear encoding models from six interpretable feature families: mel-spectrogram, Gabor filter bank features, speech presence, phonetic, syntactic, and semantic Question-Answering features, and contextualized embeddings from three state-of-the-art SSMs (Whisper, HuBERT, WavLM), quantifying the shared and unique neural variance captured by each feature class. Contrary to prevailing assumptions, our interpretable model predicted electrocorticography (ECoG) responses to speech more accurately than any SSM. Moreover, augmenting SSM representations with interpretable features yielded the best overall neural predictions, significantly outperforming either class alone. Further variance-partitioning analyses revealed previously unresolved components of SSM representations that contribute to their neural alignment: 1. Despite the common assumption that later layers of SSMs discard low-level acoustic information, these models compress and preferentially retain frequency bands critical for neural encoding of speech (100-1000 Hz). 2. Contrary to previous claims, SSMs encode brain-relevant semantic information that cannot be reduced to lower-level features, improving with context length and model size. These results highlight the importance of using refined, interpretable features in understanding speech perception."

        "summary": "arXiv:2507.05724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures have expanded from language modeling to automatic speech recognition (ASR). Traditional MoE methods, such as the Switch Transformer, route experts independently within each layer. Our analysis reveals that routers in most layers make expert choices that are not strongly correlated with the choices of the routers in other layers. To increase the cooperation between experts in different layers and encourage greater specialization, we use a shared router across different MoE layers. We call this model Omni-router Transformer. Extensive experiments on a large-scale pseudo-labeled dataset and evaluations across 10 diverse, out-of-domain ASR benchmarks demonstrate that the Omni-router Transformer is able to achieve lower training loss and consistently outperform dense and Switch Transformer models, reducing average word error rates by 11.2% and 8.2%, respectively, while providing structured expert usage and improved robustness to diverse data."

        "summary": "arXiv:2507.14915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Well-coordinated, music-aligned holistic dance enhances emotional expressiveness and audience engagement. However, generating such dances remains challenging due to the scarcity of holistic 3D dance datasets, the difficulty of achieving cross-modal alignment between music and dance, and the complexity of modeling interdependent motion across the body, hands, and face. To address these challenges, we introduce SoulDance, a high-precision music-dance paired dataset captured via professional motion capture systems, featuring meticulously annotated holistic dance movements. Building on this dataset, we propose SoulNet, a framework designed to generate music-aligned, kinematically coordinated holistic dance sequences. SoulNet consists of three principal components: (1) Hierarchical Residual Vector Quantization, which models complex, fine-grained motion dependencies across the body, hands, and face; (2) Music-Aligned Generative Model, which composes these hierarchical motion units into expressive and coordinated holistic dance; (3) Music-Motion Retrieval Module, a pre-trained cross-modal model that functions as a music-dance alignment prior, ensuring temporal synchronization and semantic coherence between generated dance and input music throughout the generation process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SoulNet significantly surpasses existing approaches in generating high-quality, music-coordinated, and well-aligned holistic 3D dance sequences."
