        "summary": "arXiv:2505.04628v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Expanding the application of large language models (LLMs) to societal life, instead of primary function only as auxiliary assistants to communicate with only one person at a time, necessitates LLMs' capabilities to independently play roles in multi-user, multi-turn social agent tasks within complex social settings. However, currently the capability has not been systematically measured with available benchmarks. To address this gap, we first introduce an agent task leveling framework grounded in sociological principles. Concurrently, we propose a novel benchmark, How Social Is It (we call it HSII below), designed to assess LLM's social capabilities in comprehensive social agents tasks and benchmark representative models. HSII comprises four stages: format parsing, target selection, target switching conversation, and stable conversation, which collectively evaluate the communication and task completion capabilities of LLMs within realistic social interaction scenarios dataset, HSII-Dataset. The dataset is derived step by step from news dataset. We perform an ablation study by doing clustering to the dataset. Additionally, we investigate the impact of chain of thought (COT) method on enhancing LLMs' social performance. Since COT cost more computation, we further introduce a new statistical metric, COT-complexity, to quantify the efficiency of certain LLMs with COTs for specific social tasks and strike a better trade-off between measurement of correctness and efficiency. Various results of our experiments demonstrate that our benchmark is well-suited for evaluating social skills in LLMs."

        "summary": "arXiv:2505.04634v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The recent progress of using graph based encoding of crystal structures for high throughput material property prediction has been quite successful. However, using a single modality model prevents us from exploiting the advantages of an enhanced features space by combining different representations. Specifically, pre-trained Large language models(LLMs) can encode a large amount of knowledge which is beneficial for training of models. Moreover, the graph encoder is able to learn the local features while the text encoder is able to learn global information such as space group and crystal symmetry. In this work, we propose Material Multi-Modal Fusion(MatMMFuse), a fusion based model which uses a multi-head attention mechanism for the combination of structure aware embedding from the Crystal Graph Convolution Network (CGCNN) and text embeddings from the SciBERT model. We train our model in an end-to-end framework using data from the Materials Project Dataset. We show that our proposed model shows an improvement compared to the vanilla CGCNN and SciBERT model for all four key properties: formation energy, band gap, energy above hull and fermi energy. Specifically, we observe an improvement of 40% compared to the vanilla CGCNN model and 68% compared to the SciBERT model for predicting the formation energy per atom. Importantly, we demonstrate the zero shot performance of the trained model on small curated datasets of Perovskites, Chalcogenides and the Jarvis Dataset. The results show that the proposed model exhibits better zero shot performance than the individual plain vanilla CGCNN and SciBERT model. This enables researchers to deploy the model for specialized industrial applications where collection of training data is prohibitively expensive."

This research presents a systematic investigation into the parallels between human cross-modal chunking mechanisms and token representation methodologies in MLLMs. Through empirical studies comparing human performance patterns with model behaviors across visual-linguistic tasks, we demonstrate that conventional static tokenization schemes fundamentally constrain current models' capacity to simulate the dynamic, context-sensitive nature of human information processing. We propose a novel framework for dynamic cross-modal tokenization that incorporates adaptive boundaries, hierarchical representations, and alignment mechanisms grounded in cognitive science principles. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our approach yields statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art models on benchmark tasks (+7.8% on Visual Question Answering, +5.3% on Complex Scene Description) while exhibiting more human-aligned error patterns and attention distributions. These findings contribute to the theoretical understanding of the relationship between human cognition and artificial intelligence, while providing empirical evidence for developing more cognitively plausible AI systems."

However, effective cross-cultural communication requires handling both aspects simultaneously - translating content while adapting the speaker's accent to match the target language context. In this work, we propose a unified approach for simultaneous speech translation and change of accent, a task that remains underexplored in current literature. Our method reformulates the problem as a conditional generation task, where target speech is generated based on phonemes and guided by target speech features. Leveraging the power of diffusion models, known for high-fidelity generative capabilities, we adapt text-to-image diffusion strategies by conditioning on source speech transcriptions and generating Mel spectrograms representing the target speech with desired linguistic and accentual attributes. This integrated framework enables joint optimization of translation and accent adaptation, offering a more parameter-efficient and effective model compared to traditional pipelines."

While many recent approaches leverage complex attention mechanisms and hierarchical architectures, we propose a lightweight, yet effective fusion-based deep learning model tailored for utterance-level emotion classification. Using the benchmark IEMOCAP dataset, which includes aligned text, audio-derived numeric features, and visual descriptors, we design a modality-specific encoder using fully connected layers followed by dropout regularization. The modality-specific representations are then fused using simple concatenation and passed through a dense fusion layer to capture cross-modal interactions. This streamlined architecture avoids computational overhead while preserving performance, achieving a classification accuracy of 92% across six emotion categories. Our approach demonstrates that with careful feature engineering and modular design, simpler fusion strategies can outperform or match more complex models, particularly in resource-constrained environments."

The applicability is demonstrated in Swedish hate crime statistics based on Swedish police reports. Estimates of the yearly number of hate crimes and the police's under-reporting are derived using the Hansen-Hurwitz estimator, difference estimation, and stratified random sampling estimation. We conclude that if labeled training data is available, the proposed method can provide very efficient estimates with reduced time spent on manual annotation."

We evaluated ChatGPT 4o to grade SAQs in a postgraduate medical setting using data from 215 students (557 short-answer responses) enrolled in an online course on mechanical ventilation (2020--2024). Deidentified responses to three case-based scenarios were presented to ChatGPT with a standardised grading prompt and rubric. Outputs were analysed using mixed-effects modelling, variance component analysis, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), Cohen's kappa, Kendall's W, and Bland--Altman statistics. ChatGPT awarded systematically lower marks than human graders with a mean difference (bias) of -1.34 on a 10-point scale. ICC values indicated poor individual-level agreement (ICC1 = 0.086), and Cohen's kappa (-0.0786) suggested no meaningful agreement. Variance component analysis showed minimal variability among the five ChatGPT sessions (G-value = 0.87), indicating internal consistency but divergence from the human grader. The poorest agreement was observed for evaluative and analytic items, whereas checklist and prescriptive rubric items had less disagreement. We caution against the use of LLMs in grading postgraduate coursework. Over 60% of ChatGPT-assigned grades differed from human grades by more than acceptable boundaries for high-stakes assessments."

Instant messaging platforms permit clinicians and patients to upload and discuss multimodal medical artifacts seamlessly in medical consultation, but the ability of LLMs to reason over such data while preserving other attributes of competent diagnostic conversation remains unknown. Here we advance the conversational diagnosis and management performance of the Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer (AMIE) through a new capability to gather and interpret multimodal data, and reason about this precisely during consultations. Leveraging Gemini 2.0 Flash, our system implements a state-aware dialogue framework, where conversation flow is dynamically controlled by intermediate model outputs reflecting patient states and evolving diagnoses. Follow-up questions are strategically directed by uncertainty in such patient states, leading to a more structured multimodal history-taking process that emulates experienced clinicians. We compared AMIE to primary care physicians (PCPs) in a randomized, blinded, OSCE-style study of chat-based consultations with patient actors. We constructed 105 evaluation scenarios using artifacts like smartphone skin photos, ECGs, and PDFs of clinical documents across diverse conditions and demographics. Our rubric assessed multimodal capabilities and other clinically meaningful axes like history-taking, diagnostic accuracy, management reasoning, communication, and empathy.

Results indicate that dataset characteristics significantly influence the effectiveness of synthetic data, with LLM-generated data performing best in low-frequency settings (e.g., 20Hz) while showing instability in high-frequency datasets (e.g., 200Hz). While text-to-motion models produce more realistic biomechanical data than text-to-text models, their impact on fall detection varies.

To this end, this paper studies the personalized risks and regulatory strategies of large language models in digital advertising. This study first outlines the principles of Large Language Model (LLM), especially the self-attention mechanism based on the Transformer architecture, and how to enable the model to understand and generate natural language text. Then, the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model and the attention mechanism are combined to construct an algorithmic model for personalized advertising recommendations and user factor risk protection. The specific steps include: data collection and preprocessing, feature selection and construction, using large language models such as BERT for advertising semantic embedding, and ad recommendations based on user portraits. Then, local model training and data encryption are used to ensure the security of user privacy and avoid the leakage of personal data. This paper designs an experiment for personalized advertising recommendation based on a large language model of BERT and verifies it with real user data. The experimental results show that BERT-based advertising push can effectively improve the click-through rate and conversion rate of advertisements. At the same time, through local model training and privacy protection mechanisms, the risk of user privacy leakage can be reduced to a certain extent."

They are often extensive, complex, and subject to frequent updates, making manual querying challenging and time-consuming. Key difficulties include navigating large volumes of text, interpreting technical language, and identifying relevant clauses across different sections. A potential solution is to build a Question-Answering (QA) system that answers user queries based on building codes. Among the various methods for building a QA system, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) stands out in performance. RAG consists of two components: a retriever and a language model. This study focuses on identifying a suitable retriever method for building codes and optimizing the generational capability of the language model using fine-tuning techniques. We conducted a detailed evaluation of various retrieval methods by performing the retrieval on the National Building Code of Canada (NBCC) and explored the impact of domain-specific fine-tuning on several language models using the dataset derived from NBCC. Our analysis included a comparative assessment of different retrievers and the performance of both pre-trained and fine-tuned models to determine the efficacy and domain-specific adaptation of language models using fine-tuning on the NBCC dataset. Experimental results showed that Elasticsearch proved to be the most robust retriever among all. The findings also indicate that fine-tuning language models on an NBCC-specific dataset can enhance their ability to generate contextually relevant responses. When combined with context retrieved by a powerful retriever like Elasticsearch, this improvement in LLM performance can optimize the RAG system, enabling it to better navigate the complexities of the NBCC."

To enhance accuracy during the reasoning process, external Process Reward Models (PRMs) can be introduced during training and inference to provide fine-grained supervision. However, if misused, PRMs may distort the reasoning trajectory and lead to suboptimal or incorrect SQL generation.To address this challenge, we propose Reward-SQL, a framework that systematically explores how to incorporate PRMs into the Text-to-SQL reasoning process effectively. Our approach follows a \"cold start, then PRM supervision\" paradigm. Specifically, we first train the model to decompose SQL queries into structured stepwise reasoning chains using common table expressions (Chain-of-CTEs), establishing a strong and interpretable reasoning baseline. Then, we investigate four strategies for integrating PRMs, and find that combining PRM as an online training signal (GRPO) with PRM-guided inference (e.g., best-of-N sampling) yields the best results. Empirically, on the BIRD benchmark, Reward-SQL enables models supervised by a 7B PRM to achieve a 13.1% performance gain across various guidance strategies. Notably, our GRPO-aligned policy model based on Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct achieves 68.9% accuracy on the BIRD development set, outperforming all baseline methods under the same model size. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of Reward-SQL in leveraging reward-based supervision for Text-to-SQL reasoning. Our code is publicly available."

Here we propose Histo-Miner, a deep learning-based pipeline for analysis of skin WSIs and generate two datasets with labeled nuclei and tumor regions. We develop our pipeline for the analysis of patient samples of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), a frequent non-melanoma skin cancer. Utilizing the two datasets, comprising 47,392 annotated cell nuclei and 144 tumor-segmented WSIs respectively, both from cSCC patients, Histo-Miner employs convolutional neural networks and vision transformers for nucleus segmentation and classification as well as tumor region segmentation. Performance of trained models positively compares to state of the art with multi-class Panoptic Quality (mPQ) of 0.569 for nucleus segmentation, macro-averaged F1 of 0.832 for nucleus classification and mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.884 for tumor region segmentation. From these predictions we generate a compact feature vector summarizing tissue morphology and cellular interactions, which can be used for various downstream tasks. Here, we use Histo-Miner to predict cSCC patient response to immunotherapy based on pre-treatment WSIs from 45 patients. Histo-Miner identifies percentages of lymphocytes, the granulocyte to lymphocyte ratio in tumor vicinity and the distances between granulocytes and plasma cells in tumors as predictive features for therapy response. This highlights the applicability of Histo-Miner to clinically relevant scenarios, providing direct interpretation of the classification and insights into the underlying biology."

Traditional safety evaluation frameworks, designed for text-based, single-turn interactions, are inadequate for addressing these complexities. To bridge this gap, we introduce the REVEAL (Responsible Evaluation of Vision-Enabled AI LLMs) Framework, a scalable and automated pipeline for evaluating image-input harms in VLLMs. REVEAL includes automated image mining, synthetic adversarial data generation, multi-turn conversational expansion using crescendo attack strategies, and comprehensive harm assessment through evaluators like GPT-4o.\n  We extensively evaluated five state-of-the-art VLLMs, GPT-4o, Llama-3.2, Qwen2-VL, Phi3.5V, and Pixtral, across three important harm categories: sexual harm, violence, and misinformation. Our findings reveal that multi-turn interactions result in significantly higher defect rates compared to single-turn evaluations, highlighting deeper vulnerabilities in VLLMs. Notably, GPT-4o demonstrated the most balanced performance as measured by our Safety-Usability Index (SUI) followed closely by Pixtral.

The proposed framework compares the results obtained from these pose trackers with the manual annotations of biomechanical experts for more than 5870 frames.

In this paper, we investigate whether newly proposed methods genuinely outperform the state of the art by analyzing a representative cohort of medical imaging papers. We quantify the probability of false claims based on a Bayesian approach that leverages reported results alongside empirically estimated model congruence to estimate whether the relative ranking of methods is likely to have occurred by chance. According to our results, the majority (>80%) of papers claims outperformance when introducing a new method. Our analysis further revealed a high probability (>5%) of false outperformance claims in 86% of classification papers and 53% of segmentation papers.

We build on conformal prediction, a statistical tool for generating prediction sets that cover the test label with a pre-specified probability. The validity of conformal prediction, however, holds under the i.i.d assumption, which does not hold in our setting due to the corruptions in the data. To account for this distribution shift, the privileged conformal prediction (PCP) method proposed leveraging privileged information (PI) -- additional features available only during training -- to re-weight the data distribution, yielding valid prediction sets under the assumption that the weights are accurate. In this work, we analyze the robustness of PCP to inaccuracies in the weights. Our analysis indicates that PCP can still yield valid uncertainty estimates even when the weights are poorly estimated. Furthermore, we introduce uncertain imputation (UI), a new conformal method that does not rely on weight estimation. Instead, we impute corrupted labels in a way that preserves their uncertainty. Our approach is supported by theoretical guarantees and validated empirically on both synthetic and real benchmarks. Finally, we show that these techniques can be integrated into a triply robust framework, ensuring statistically valid predictions as long as at least one underlying method is valid."

However, standard DeepONet requires input functions to be sampled at fixed locations, limiting its applicability in scenarios with variable sensor configurations, missing data, or irregular grids. We introduce the Set Operator Network (SetONet), a novel architecture that integrates Deep Sets principles into the DeepONet framework to address this limitation. The core innovation lies in the SetONet branch network, which processes the input function as an unordered \\emph{set} of location-value pairs. This design ensures permutation invariance with respect to the input points, making SetONet inherently robust to variations in the number and locations of sensors. SetONet learns richer, spatially-aware input representations by explicitly processing spatial coordinates and function values. We demonstrate SetONet's effectiveness on several benchmark problems, including derivative/anti-derivative operators, 1D Darcy flow, and 2D elasticity. Results show that SetONet successfully learns operators under variable input sampling conditions where standard DeepONet fails. Furthermore, SetONet is architecturally robust to sensor drop-off; unlike standard DeepONet, which requires methods like interpolation to function with missing data. Notably, SetONet can achieve comparable or improved accuracy over DeepONet on fixed grids, particularly for nonlinear problems, likely due to its enhanced input representation. SetONet provides a flexible and robust extension to the neural operator toolkit, significantly broadening the applicability of operator learning to problems with variable or incomplete input data."

Specifically, we explore the possibility that pre-training on more toxic data can lead to better control in post-training, ultimately decreasing a model's output toxicity. First, we use a toy experiment to study how data composition affects the geometry of features in the representation space. Next, through controlled experiments with Olmo-1B models trained on varying ratios of clean and toxic data, we find that the concept of toxicity enjoys a less entangled linear representation as the proportion of toxic data increases. Furthermore, we show that although toxic data increases the generational toxicity of the base model, it also makes the toxicity easier to remove. Evaluations on Toxigen and Real Toxicity Prompts demonstrate that models trained on toxic data achieve a better trade-off between reducing generational toxicity and preserving general capabilities when detoxifying techniques such as inference-time intervention (ITI) are applied. Our findings suggest that, with post-training taken into account, bad data may lead to good models."

Concerning depth quality, we introduce the Depth Anything Model to generate high-quality depth maps,which effectively alleviates the multi-modal gaps in the current datasets. For modality fusion, we propose a Decoupled Attention Module (DAM) to explore the consistency within and between modalities. Here, the multi-modal features are decoupled into dual-view feature vectors to project discriminable information of feature maps. For feature representation, we develop a Dual Information Representation Module (DIRM) with a bi-directional inverted framework to enlarge the limited feature space generated by the lightweight backbones. DIRM models texture features and saliency features to enrich feature space, and employ two-way prediction heads to optimal its parameters through a bi-directional backpropagation. Finally, we design a Dual Feature Aggregation Module (DFAM) in the decoder to aggregate texture and saliency features. Extensive experiments on five public RGB-D SOD datasets indicate that the proposed SATNet excels state-of-the-art (SOTA) CNN-based heavyweight models and achieves a lightweight framework with 5.2 M parameters and 415 FPS."

While previous scholarship has examined these domains independently, the systematic correlation between evolving literary emotions and visual culture remains underexplored. This study addresses that gap by employing BERT-based sentiment analysis to quantify emotional patterns in floral imagery across Tang Song poetry, then validating these patterns against contemporaneous developments in decorative arts.Our approach builds upon recent advances in computational humanities while remaining grounded in traditional sinological methods. By applying a fine tuned BERT model to analyze peony and plum blossom imagery in classical poetry, we detect measurable shifts in emotional connotations between the Tang and Song periods. These textual patterns are then cross berenced with visual evidence from textiles, ceramics, and other material culture, revealing previously unrecognized synergies between literary expression and artistic representation."

Our work presents a novel uncertainty-driven Unsupervised Continual Learning framework using Generative Replay, namely ``Replay to Remember (R2R)''. The proposed R2R architecture efficiently uses unlabelled and synthetic labelled data in a balanced proportion using a cluster-level uncertainty-driven feedback mechanism and a VLM-powered generative replay module. Unlike traditional memory-buffer methods that depend on pretrained models and pseudo-labels, our R2R framework operates without any prior training. It leverages visual features from unlabeled data and adapts continuously using clustering-based uncertainty estimation coupled with dynamic thresholding. Concurrently, a generative replay mechanism along with DeepSeek-R1 powered CLIP VLM produces labelled synthetic data representative of past experiences, resembling biological visual thinking that replays memory to remember and act in new, unseen tasks. Extensive experimental analyses are carried out in CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CINIC-10, SVHN and TinyImageNet datasets. Our proposed R2R approach improves knowledge retention, achieving a state-of-the-art performance of 98.13%, 73.06%, 93.41%, 95.18%, 59.74%, respectively, surpassing state-of-the-art performance by over 4.36%."

Existing methods are, however, either sub-optimal solvers or pursuing global optimality at a significant cost of computing time. In contrast to prior works, we introduce convex relaxation techniques to solve this task for the first time. Specifically, we employ a ``soft'' association scheme, realized via a truncated multi-selection error, that allows for joint estimation of VPs' locations and line-VP associations. This approach leads to a primal problem that can be reformulated into a quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problem, which is then relaxed into a convex semidefinite programming (SDP) problem. To solve this SDP problem efficiently, we present a globally optimal outlier-robust iterative solver (called \\textbf{GlobustVP}), which independently searches for one VP and its associated lines in each iteration, treating other lines as outliers. After each independent update of all VPs, the mutual orthogonality between the three VPs in a Manhattan world is reinforced via local refinement. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that \\textbf{GlobustVP} achieves a favorable balance between efficiency, robustness, and global optimality compared to previous works.

Evidently, this is due to extreme data variability factors such as resolution, viewpoint changes, scale variations, occlusions, and appearance shifts from clothing or session drifts. Moreover, the publicly available data sets do not realistically incorporate such kinds and magnitudes of variability, which limits the progress of this technology. This paper introduces DetReIDX, a large-scale aerial-ground person dataset, that was explicitly designed as a stress test to ReID under real-world conditions. DetReIDX is a multi-session set that includes over 13 million bounding boxes from 509 identities, collected in seven university campuses from three continents, with drone altitudes between 5.8 and 120 meters. More important, as a key novelty, DetReIDX subjects were recorded in (at least) two sessions on different days, with changes in clothing, daylight and location, making it suitable to actually evaluate long-term person ReID. Plus, data were annotated from 16 soft biometric attributes and multitask labels for detection, tracking, ReID, and action recognition. In order to provide empirical evidence of DetReIDX usefulness, we considered the specific tasks of human detection and ReID, where SOTA methods catastrophically degrade performance (up to 80% in detection accuracy and over 70% in Rank-1 ReID) when exposed to DetReIDXs conditions.

Among all the technical challenges to enforcing these regulations, one crucial, yet under-explored problem is the risk of manipulation while these systems are being audited for fairness. This manipulation occurs when a platform deliberately alters its answers to a regulator to pass an audit without modifying its answers to other users. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to manipulation-proof auditing by taking into account the auditor's prior knowledge of the task solved by the platform. We first demonstrate that regulators must not rely on public priors (e.g. a public dataset), as platforms could easily fool the auditor in such cases. We then formally establish the conditions under which an auditor can prevent audit manipulations using prior knowledge about the ground truth. Finally, our experiments with two standard datasets exemplify the maximum level of unfairness a platform can hide before being detected as malicious. Our formalization and generalization of manipulation-proof auditing with a prior opens up new research directions for more robust fairness audits."

However, increasing the polynomial degree is computationally expensive and beyond certain thresholds leads to performance plateaus or degradation. In this paper, we introduce the Piecewise Constant Spectral Graph Neural Network(PieCoN) to address these challenges. PieCoN combines constant spectral filters with polynomial filters to provide a more flexible way to leverage the graph structure. By adaptively partitioning the spectrum into intervals, our approach increases the range of spectral properties that can be effectively learned.

While Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is a practical approach for reducing computational overhead, existing PTQ methods rely on fixed bit-width quantization, leading to suboptimal accuracy and efficiency. To address this limitation, we propose Mix-QSAM, a mixed-precision PTQ framework for SAM. First, we introduce a layer-wise importance score, derived using Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, to quantify each layer's contribution to the model's output. Second, we introduce cross-layer synergy, a novel metric based on causal mutual information, to capture dependencies between adjacent layers. This ensures that highly interdependent layers maintain similar bit-widths, preventing abrupt precision mismatches that degrade feature propagation and numerical stability. Using these metrics, we formulate an Integer Quadratic Programming (IQP) problem to determine optimal bit-width allocation under model size and bit-operation constraints, assigning higher precision to critical layers while minimizing bit-width in less influential layers. Experimental results demonstrate that Mix-QSAM consistently outperforms existing PTQ methods on instance segmentation and object detection tasks, achieving up to 20% higher average precision under 6-bit and 4-bit mixed-precision settings, while maintaining computational efficiency."

To resolve this issue, we introduce a novel approach that first searches for quantization policies on small datasets and then generalizes them to large-scale datasets. This approach simplifies the process, eliminating the need for large-scale quantization fine-tuning and only necessitating model weight adjustment. Our method is characterized by three key techniques: sharpness-aware minimization for enhanced quantization generalization, implicit gradient direction alignment to handle gradient conflicts among different optimization objectives, and an adaptive perturbation radius to accelerate optimization. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results validate our approach. Using the CIFAR10 dataset (just 0.5\\% the size of ImageNet training data) for MPQ policy search, we achieved equivalent accuracy on ImageNet with a significantly lower computational cost, while improving efficiency by up to 150% over the baselines."

Existing compression methods either operate post-hoc pruning, risking disruption to reasoning coherence, or rely on sampling-based selection, which fails to intervene effectively during generation. In this work, we introduce a confidence-guided perspective to explain the emergence of redundant reflection in LRMs, identifying two key patterns: Confidence Deficit, where the model reconsiders correct steps due to low internal confidence, and Termination Delay, where reasoning continues even after reaching a confident answer. Based on this analysis, we propose ConCISE (Confidence-guided Compression In Step-by-step Efficient Reasoning), a framework that simplifies reasoning chains by reinforcing the model's confidence during inference, thus preventing the generation of redundant reflection steps. It integrates Confidence Injection to stabilize intermediate steps and Early Stopping to terminate reasoning when confidence is sufficient. Extensive experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning LRMs on ConCISE-generated data yields significantly shorter outputs, reducing length by up to approximately 50% under SimPO, while maintaining high task accuracy. ConCISE consistently outperforms existing baselines across multiple reasoning benchmarks."

In particular, we observe alarming levels of confusion, deception, and loss of faith regarding multimedia content within society caused by face deepfakes, and existing deepfake detectors are struggling to keep up with the pace of improvements in deepfake generation. This is primarily due to their reliance on specific forgery artifacts, which limits their ability to generalise and detect novel deepfake types. To combat the spread of malicious face deepfakes, this paper proposes a new strategy that leverages coarse-to-fine spatial information, semantic information, and their interactions while ensuring feature distinctiveness and reducing the redundancy of the modelled features. A novel feature orthogonality-based disentanglement strategy is introduced to ensure branch-level and cross-branch feature disentanglement, which allows us to integrate multiple feature vectors without adding complexity to the feature space or compromising generalisation. Comprehensive experiments on three public benchmarks: FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF, and the Deepfake Detection Challenge (DFDC) show that these design choices enable the proposed approach to outperform current state-of-the-art methods by 5% on the Celeb-DF dataset and 7% on the DFDC dataset in a cross-dataset evaluation setting."

Substantial efforts have been made to integrate local differential privacy (LDP) into the system to achieve a strict privacy guarantee. However, existing methods fail to take practical issues into account by merely perturbing each sample with the same mechanism while each client may have their own privacy preferences on privacy-sensitive information (PSI), which is not uniformly distributed across the raw data. In such a case, excessive privacy protection from private-insensitive information can additionally introduce unnecessary noise, which may degrade the model performance. In this work, we study the PSI within data and develop FedRE, that can simultaneously achieve robustness and effectiveness benefits with LDP protection. More specifically, we first define PSI with regard to the privacy preferences of each client. Then, we optimize the LDP by allocating less privacy budget to gradients with higher PSI in a layer-wise manner, thus providing a stricter privacy guarantee for PSI. Furthermore, to mitigate the performance degradation caused by LDP, we design a parameter aggregation mechanism based on the distribution of the perturbed information. We conducted experiments with text tamper detection on T-SROIE and DocTamper datasets, and FedRE achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods."

Tools like CellChat have demonstrated that CCC plays a critical role in processes such as cell differentiation, tissue regeneration, and immune response, and that transcriptomic data inherently encodes rich information about intercellular signaling. We propose CCCVAE, a novel variational autoencoder framework that incorporates CCC signals into single-cell representation learning. By leveraging a communication-aware kernel derived from ligand-receptor interactions and a sparse Gaussian process, CCCVAE encodes biologically informed priors into the latent space. Unlike conventional VAEs that treat each cell independently, CCCVAE encourages latent embeddings to reflect both transcriptional similarity and intercellular signaling context. Empirical results across four scRNA-seq datasets show that CCCVAE improves clustering performance, achieving higher evaluation scores than standard VAE baselines.

Our non-asymptotic state evolution theory captures Gaussian fluctuations in first-layer weights and concentration in deeper-layer weights, and remains valid for non-Gaussian features.\n  Our theory differs from existing neural tangent kernel (NTK), mean-field (MF) theories and tensor program (TP) in several key aspects. First, our theory operates in the finite-width regime whereas these existing theories are fundamentally infinite-width. Second, our theory allows weights to evolve from individual initializations beyond the lazy training regime, whereas NTK and MF are either frozen at or only weakly sensitive to initialization, and TP relies on special initialization schemes. Third, our theory characterizes both training and generalization errors for general multi-layer neural networks beyond the uniform convergence regime, whereas existing theories study generalization almost exclusively in two-layer settings.\n  As a statistical application, we show that vanilla gradient descent can be augmented to yield consistent estimates of the generalization error at each iteration, which can be used to guide early stopping and hyperparameter tuning. As a further theoretical implication, we show that despite model misspecification, the model learned by gradient descent retains the structure of a single-index function with an effective signal determined by a linear combination of the true signal and the initialization."

Unlike conventional approaches that produce holistic features, OWT explicitly disentangles an image into separable token groups, each corresponding to a distinct organ or semantic entity. Our design ensures each token group encapsulates organ-specific information, boosting interpretability, generalization, and efficiency while allowing fine-grained control in downstream tasks. Experiments on CT and MRI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of OWT in not only achieving strong image reconstruction and segmentation performance, but also enabling novel semantic-level generation and retrieval applications that are out of reach for standard holistic embedding methods. These findings underscore the potential of OWT as a foundational framework for semantically disentangled representation learning, offering broad scalability and applicability to real-world medical imaging scenarios and beyond."

Current studies focus on the Class Activation Map (CAM) of CNN and the self-attention map of transformer to identify the region of objects. However, both CAM and self-attention maps can not learn pixel-level fine-grained information on the foreground objects, which hinders the further advance of WSOL. To address this problem, we initiatively leverage the capability of zero-shot generalization and fine-grained segmentation in Segment Anything Model (SAM) to boost the activation of integral object regions. Further, to alleviate the semantic ambiguity issue accrued in single point prompt-based SAM, we propose an innovative mask prompt to SAM (Pro2SAM) network with grid points for WSOL task. First, we devise a Global Token Transformer (GTFormer) to generate a coarse-grained foreground map as a flexible mask prompt, where the GTFormer jointly embeds patch tokens and novel global tokens to learn foreground semantics. Secondly, we deliver grid points as dense prompts into SAM to maximize the probability of foreground mask, which avoids the lack of objects caused by a single point/box prompt. Finally, we propose a pixel-level similarity metric to come true the mask matching from mask prompt to SAM, where the mask with the highest score is viewed as the final localization map. Experiments show that the proposed Pro2SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance on both CUB-200-2011 and ILSVRC, with 84.03\\% and 66.85\\% Top-1 Loc, respectively."

We integrate contrastive learning to enhance feature representation by aligning instances of the same class across domains while separating different classes.

We evaluate VaCDA on multiple publicly available datasets across three heterogeneity scenarios: cross-person, cross-position, and cross-device. VaCDA outperforms the baselines in cross-position and cross-device scenarios."

These methods often generate distorted or unrecognizable characters, particularly when dealing with complex characters like Chinese. In such systems, characters are composed of intricate stroke patterns and spatial relationships that must be precisely maintained. We present GlyphMastero, a specialized glyph encoder designed to guide the latent diffusion model for generating texts with stroke-level precision. Our key insight is that existing methods, despite using pretrained OCR models for feature extraction, fail to capture the hierarchical nature of text structures - from individual strokes to stroke-level interactions to overall character-level structure. To address this, our glyph encoder explicitly models and captures the cross-level interactions between local-level individual characters and global-level text lines through our novel glyph attention module. Meanwhile, our model implements a feature pyramid network to fuse the multi-scale OCR backbone features at the global-level. Through these cross-level and multi-scale fusions, we obtain more detailed glyph-aware guidance, enabling precise control over the scene text generation process.

Large Multimodal Reasoning Models (LMRMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm, integrating modalities such as text, images, audio, and video to support complex reasoning capabilities and aiming to achieve comprehensive perception, precise understanding, and deep reasoning. As research advances, multimodal reasoning has rapidly evolved from modular, perception-driven pipelines to unified, language-centric frameworks that offer more coherent cross-modal understanding. While instruction tuning and reinforcement learning have improved model reasoning, significant challenges remain in omni-modal generalization, reasoning depth, and agentic behavior. To address these issues, we present a comprehensive and structured survey of multimodal reasoning research, organized around a four-stage developmental roadmap that reflects the field's shifting design philosophies and emerging capabilities. First, we review early efforts based on task-specific modules, where reasoning was implicitly embedded across stages of representation, alignment, and fusion. Next, we examine recent approaches that unify reasoning into multimodal LLMs, with advances such as Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) and multimodal reinforcement learning enabling richer and more structured reasoning chains.

Recently, achieving reliable depression predictions through uncertainty quantification has attracted increasing attention. However, few studies have focused on the fairness of uncertainty quantification (UQ) in depression prediction. In this work, we investigate the algorithmic fairness of UQ, namely Equal Opportunity Coverage (EOC) fairness, and propose Fair Uncertainty Quantification (FUQ) for depression prediction. FUQ pursues reliable and fair depression predictions through group-based analysis. Specifically, we first group all the participants by different sensitive attributes and leverage conformal prediction to quantify uncertainty within each demographic group, which provides a theoretically guaranteed and valid way to quantify uncertainty for depression prediction and facilitates the investigation of fairness across different demographic groups. Furthermore, we propose a fairness-aware optimization strategy that formulates fairness as a constrained optimization problem under EOC constraints. This enables the model to preserve predictive reliability while adapting to the heterogeneous uncertainty levels across demographic groups, thereby achieving optimal fairness. Through extensive evaluations on several visual and audio depression datasets, our approach demonstrates its effectiveness."

To address this, we construct a new pyramid registration network based on feature and deformation field (FF-PNet). For coarse-grained feature extraction, we design a Residual Feature Fusion Module (RFFM), for fine-grained image deformation, we propose a Residual Deformation Field Fusion Module (RDFFM). Through the parallel operation of these two modules, the model can effectively handle complex image deformations. It is worth emphasizing that the encoding stage of FF-PNet only employs traditional convolutional neural networks without any attention mechanisms or multilayer perceptrons, yet it still achieves remarkable improvements in registration accuracy, fully demonstrating the superior feature decoding capabilities of RFFM and RDFFM. We conducted extensive experiments on the LPBA and OASIS datasets. The results show our network consistently outperforms popular methods in metrics like the Dice Similarity Coefficient."

As such, with the growth of KG use has been a concurrent development of machine learning tools designed to predict missing information in KGs, which is referred to as the Link Prediction Task. The majority of state-of-the-art link predictors to date have followed an embedding-based paradigm. In this paradigm, it is assumed that the information content of a KG is best represented by the (individual) vector representations of its nodes and edges, and that therefore node and edge embeddings are particularly well-suited to performing link prediction.\n  This thesis proposes an alternative perspective on the field's approach to link prediction and KG data modelling. Specifically, this work re-analyses KGs and state-of-the-art link predictors from a graph-structure-first perspective that models the information content of a KG in terms of whole triples, rather than individual nodes and edges.\n  Following a literature review and two core sets of experiments, this thesis concludes that a structure-first perspective on KGs and link prediction is both viable and useful for understanding KG learning and for enabling cross-KG transfer learning for the link prediction task. This observation is used to create and propose the Structural Alignment Hypothesis, which postulates that link prediction can be understood and modelled as a structural task.\n  All code and data used for this thesis are open-sourced.

First, we train a series of building extraction models using pre-disaster optical images and building labels. To enhance building segmentation, we employ multi-model fusion and test-time augmentation strategies to generate pseudo-probabilities, followed by a low-uncertainty pseudo-label training method for further refinement. Next, a change detection model is trained on bi-temporal cross-modal images and damaged building labels. To improve damage classification accuracy, we introduce a building-guided low-uncertainty pseudo-label refinement strategy, which leverages building priors from the previous step to guide pseudo-label generation for damaged buildings, reducing uncertainty and enhancing reliability.

However, the inner mechanism of CoT still remains largely unclear. In this paper, we empirically study the role of CoT tokens in LLMs on two compositional tasks: multi-digit multiplication and dynamic programming. While CoT is essential for solving these problems, we find that preserving only tokens that store intermediate results would achieve comparable performance. Furthermore, we observe that storing intermediate results in an alternative latent form will not affect model performance. We also randomly intervene some values in CoT, and notice that subsequent CoT tokens and the final answer would change correspondingly. These findings suggest that CoT tokens may function like variables in computer programs but with potential drawbacks like unintended shortcuts and computational complexity limits between tokens.

While recent progress has highlighted their potential for capturing visual semantics, adapting DPMs to graph representation learning remains in its infancy. In this paper, we introduce Graffe, a self-supervised diffusion model proposed for graph representation learning. It features a graph encoder that distills a source graph into a compact representation, which, in turn, serves as the condition to guide the denoising process of the diffusion decoder. To evaluate the effectiveness of our model, we first explore the theoretical foundations of applying diffusion models to representation learning, proving that the denoising objective implicitly maximizes the conditional mutual information between data and its representation. Specifically, we prove that the negative logarithm of the denoising score matching loss is a tractable lower bound for the conditional mutual information. Empirically, we conduct a series of case studies to validate our theoretical insights. In addition, Graffe delivers competitive results under the linear probing setting on node and graph classification tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 9 of the 11 real-world datasets. These findings indicate that powerful generative models, especially diffusion models, serve as an effective tool for graph representation learning."

Existing methods often struggle to maintain anatomical fidelity while accurately modeling pathological features, frequently relying on priors derived from natural images or inefficient multi-step sampling. In this work, we introduce ViCTr (Vital Consistency Transfer), a novel two-stage framework that combines a rectified flow trajectory with a Tweedie-corrected diffusion process to achieve high-fidelity, pathology-aware image synthesis. First, we pretrain ViCTr on the ATLAS-8k dataset using Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) to preserve critical anatomical structures. We then fine-tune the model adversarially with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules for precise control over pathology severity. By reformulating Tweedie's formula within a linear trajectory framework, ViCTr supports one-step sampling, reducing inference from 50 steps to just 4, without sacrificing anatomical realism. We evaluate ViCTr on BTCV (CT), AMOS (MRI), and CirrMRI600+ (cirrhosis) datasets. Results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving a Medical Frechet Inception Distance (MFID) of 17.01 for cirrhosis synthesis 28% lower than existing approaches and improving nnUNet segmentation by +3.8% mDSC when used for data augmentation. Radiologist reviews indicate that ViCTr-generated liver cirrhosis MRIs are clinically indistinguishable from real scans. To our knowledge, ViCTr is the first method to provide fine-grained, pathology-aware MRI synthesis with graded severity control, closing a critical gap in AI-driven medical imaging research."

However, the dynamic topologies hinder the efficient long-term joint power and antenna array resource allocation for THz links among UAVs. Furthermore, the continuous nature of power and the discrete nature of antennas cause this joint resource allocation problem to be a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem with non-convexity and NP-hardness. Inspired by recent rapid advancements in deep reinforcement learning (DRL), a graph neural network (GNN) aided DRL algorithm for resource allocation in the dynamic THz UAV network with an emphasis on self-node features (GLOVE) is proposed in this paper, with the aim of resource efficiency (RE) maximization. When training the allocation policy for each UAV, GLOVE learns the relationship between this UAV and its neighboring UAVs via GNN, while also emphasizing the important self-node features of this UAV. In addition, a multi-task structure is leveraged by GLOVE to cooperatively train resource allocation decisions for the power and sub-arrays of all UAVs. Experimental results illustrate that GLOVE outperforms benchmark schemes in terms of the highest RE and the lowest latency. Moreover, unlike the benchmark methods with severe packet loss, GLOVE maintains zero packet loss during the entire training process, demonstrating its better robustness under the highly dynamic THz UAV network."

This approach has revealed that several power laws consistently emerge across different corpora and languages, suggesting the universal principles underlying languages. Particularly, the power-law decay of correlation has been interpreted as evidence for underlying hierarchical structures in syntax, semantics, and discourse. This perspective has also been extended to child languages and animal signals. However, the argument supporting this interpretation has not been empirically tested. To address this problem, this study examines the validity of the argument for syntactic structures. Specifically, we test whether the statistical properties of parse trees align with the implicit assumptions in the argument. Using English corpora, we analyze the mutual information, deviations from probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs), and other properties in parse trees, as well as in the PCFG that approximates these trees. Our results indicate that the assumptions do not hold for syntactic structures and that it is difficult to apply the proposed argument to child languages and animal signals, highlighting the need to reconsider the relationship between the power law and hierarchical structures."

Existing approaches to preference modeling often rely on an explicit or implicit reward function, overlooking the intricate and multifaceted nature of human preferences that may encompass conflicting factors across diverse tasks and populations. To address this limitation, we introduce Latent Preference Coding (LPC), a novel framework that models the implicit factors as well as their combinations behind holistic preferences using discrete latent codes. LPC seamlessly integrates with various offline alignment algorithms, automatically inferring the underlying factors and their importance from data without relying on pre-defined reward functions and hand-crafted combination weights. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that LPC consistently improves upon three alignment algorithms (DPO, SimPO, and IPO) using three base models (Mistral-7B, Llama3-8B, and Llama3-8B-Instruct). Furthermore, deeper analysis reveals that the learned latent codes effectively capture the differences in the distribution of human preferences and significantly enhance the robustness of alignment against noise in data. By providing a unified representation for the multifarious preference factors, LPC paves the way towards developing more robust and versatile alignment techniques for the responsible deployment of powerful LLMs."

To address this issue, recent studies have introduced several variant algorithms of ICL that achieve permutation invariance. However, many of these do not exhibit comparable performance with the standard auto-regressive ICL algorithm. In this work, we identify two crucial elements in the design of an invariant ICL algorithm: information non-leakage and context interdependence, which are not simultaneously achieved by any of the existing methods. These investigations lead us to the proposed Invariant ICL (InvICL), a methodology designed to achieve invariance in ICL while ensuring the two properties. Empirically, our findings reveal that InvICL surpasses previous models, both invariant and non-invariant, in most benchmark datasets, showcasing superior generalization capabilities across varying input lengths.

Even if the input videos are stable, the stitched video can inevitably cause undesired warping shakes and affect the visual experience. To address this issue, we propose StabStitch++, a novel video stitching framework to realize spatial stitching and temporal stabilization with unsupervised learning simultaneously. First, different from existing learning-based image stitching solutions that typically warp one image to align with another, we suppose a virtual midplane between original image planes and project them onto it. Concretely, we design a differentiable bidirectional decomposition module to disentangle the homography transformation and incorporate it into our spatial warp, evenly spreading alignment burdens and projective distortions across two views. Then, inspired by camera paths in video stabilization, we derive the mathematical expression of stitching trajectories in video stitching by elaborately integrating spatial and temporal warps. Finally, a warp smoothing model is presented to produce stable stitched videos with a hybrid loss to simultaneously encourage content alignment, trajectory smoothness, and online collaboration. Compared with StabStitch that sacrifices alignment for stabilization, StabStitch++ makes no compromise and optimizes both of them simultaneously, especially in the online mode. To establish an evaluation benchmark and train the learning framework, we build a video stitching dataset with a rich diversity in camera motions and scenes. Experiments exhibit that StabStitch++ surpasses current solutions in stitching performance, robustness, and efficiency, offering compelling advancements in this field by building a real-time online video stitching system."

Current online map matching methods are prone to errors in complex road networks, especially in multilevel road area. To address this challenge, we propose an online Standard Definition (SD) map matching method by constructing a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with multiple probability factors. Our proposed method can achieve accurate map matching even in complex road networks by carefully leveraging lane markings and scenario recognition in the designing of the probability factors. First, the lane markings are generated by a multi-lane tracking method and associated with the SD map using HMM to build an enriched SD map. In areas covered by the enriched SD map, the vehicle can re-localize itself by performing Iterative Closest Point (ICP) registration for the lane markings. Then, the probability factor accounting for the lane marking detection can be obtained using the association probability between adjacent lanes and roads. Second, the driving scenario recognition model is applied to generate the emission probability factor of scenario recognition, which improves the performance of map matching on elevated roads and ordinary urban roads underneath them. We validate our method through extensive road tests in Europe and China, and the experimental results show that our proposed method effectively improves the online map matching accuracy as compared to other existing methods, especially in multilevel road area. Specifically, the experiments show that our proposed method achieves $F_1$ scores of 98.04% and 94.60% on the Zenseact Open Dataset and test data of multilevel road areas in Shanghai respectively, significantly outperforming benchmark methods.

To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive detection approach that builds upon existing architectures (e.g., YOLO) by explicitly leveraging consistent embedding representations derived through exponential moving average (EMA)-based statistical updates.\n  Our method introduces three synergistic components: (1) adaptive augmentation utilizing dynamically updated image statistics to robustly handle illumination and texture variations; (2) embedding stabilization to ensure consistent and reliable feature extraction; and (3) contextual refinement leveraging spatial context for improved detection accuracy. The pervasive use of EMA in our method is particularly advantageous given the limited visual complexity and small scale of boreholes, allowing stable and robust representation learning even under challenging visual conditions.

Two machine learning approaches, One-Class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM) and Random Forest (RF), were evaluated for user verification. Results revealed a stark contrast in performance: while One-Class SVM failed to differentiate individual users within each group, Random Forest achieved robust intra-keyboard user recognition (Accuracy > 0.7) but struggled to generalize across keyboards for the same user, highlighting the significant impact of keyboard hardware on typing behavior.

In this paper, we investigate under which conditions language models can perform these strategies correctly based on zero-shot learning and analyse whether the formatting of the group scenario in the prompt affects accuracy. We specifically focused on the impact of group complexity (number of users and items), different LLMs, different prompting conditions, including In-Context learning or generating explanations, and the formatting of group preferences. Our results show that performance starts to deteriorate when considering more than 100 ratings. However, not all language models were equally sensitive to growing group complexity. Additionally, we showed that In-Context Learning (ICL) can significantly increase the performance at higher degrees of group complexity, while adding other prompt modifications, specifying domain cues or prompting for explanations, did not impact accuracy. We conclude that future research should include group complexity as a factor in GRS evaluation due to its effect on LLM performance. Furthermore, we showed that formatting the group scenarios differently, such as rating lists per user or per item, affected accuracy. All in all, our study implies that smaller LLMs are capable of generating group recommendations under the right conditions, making the case for using smaller models that require less computing power and costs."

However, ensuring that synthetic datasets maintain high fidelity, utility, and adherence to domain-specific constraints remains a key challenge. While hyperparameter optimization (HPO) has been shown to improve generative model performance, the effectiveness of different optimization strategies for synthetic clinical data remains unclear. This study systematically evaluates four HPO strategies across eight generative models, comparing single-metric optimization against compound metric optimization approaches. Our results demonstrate that HPO consistently improves synthetic data quality, with TVAE, CTGAN, and CTAB-GAN+ achieving improvements of up to 60%, 39%, and 38%, respectively. Compound metric optimization outperformed single-metric strategies, producing more balanced and generalizable synthetic datasets. Interestingly, HPO alone is insufficient to ensure clinically valid synthetic data, as all models exhibited violations of fundamental survival constraints. Preprocessing and postprocessing played a crucial role in reducing these violations, as models lacking robust processing steps produced invalid data in up to 61% of cases. These findings underscore the necessity of integrating explicit domain knowledge alongside HPO to create high quality synthetic datasets. Our study provides actionable recommendations for improving synthetic data generation, with future research needed to refine metric selection and validate these findings on larger datasets to enhance clinical applicability."

As an alternative to fully supervised approaches, query-based segmentation has shown great latent in ZSS, as it enables object localization without relying on explicit labels. However, conventional Hungarian matching, a core component in query-based frameworks, needs full supervision and often misclassifies unseen categories as background in the setting of ZSS. To address this issue, we propose Split Matching (SM), a novel assignment strategy that decouples Hungarian matching into two components: one for seen classes in annotated regions and another for latent classes in unannotated regions (referred to as unseen candidates). Specifically, we partition the queries into seen and candidate groups, enabling each to be optimized independently according to its available supervision. To discover unseen candidates, we cluster CLIP dense features to generate pseudo masks and extract region-level embeddings using CLS tokens. Matching is then conducted separately for the two groups based on both class-level similarity and mask-level consistency. Additionally, we introduce a Multi-scale Feature Enhancement (MFE) module that refines decoder features through residual multi-scale aggregation, improving the model's ability to capture spatial details across resolutions. SM is the first to introduce decoupled Hungarian matching under the inductive ZSS setting, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on two standard benchmarks."

        "summary": "arXiv:2505.05043v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Recognising expressive behaviours in face videos is a long-standing challenge in Affective Computing. Despite significant advancements in recent years, it still remains a challenge to build a robust and reliable system for naturalistic and in-the-wild facial expressive behaviour analysis in real time. This paper addresses two key challenges in building such a system: (1). The paucity of large-scale labelled facial affect video datasets with extensive coverage of the 2D emotion space, and (2). The difficulty of extracting facial video features that are discriminative, interpretable, robust, and computationally efficient. Toward addressing these challenges, we introduce xTrace, a robust tool for facial expressive behaviour analysis and predicting continuous values of dimensional emotions, namely valence and arousal, from in-the-wild face videos.\n  To address challenge (1), our affect recognition model is trained on the largest facial affect video data set, containing ~450k videos that cover most emotion zones in the dimensional emotion space, making xTrace highly versatile in analysing a wide spectrum of naturalistic expressive behaviours. To address challenge (2), xTrace uses facial affect descriptors that are not only explainable, but can also achieve a high degree of accuracy and robustness with low computational complexity. The key components of xTrace are benchmarked against three existing tools: MediaPipe, OpenFace, and Augsburg Affect Toolbox. On an in-the-wild validation set composed of 50k videos, xTrace achieves 0.86 mean CCC and 0.13 mean absolute error values. We present a detailed error analysis of affect predictions from xTrace, illustrating (a). its ability to recognise emotions with high accuracy across most bins in the 2D emotion space, (b). its robustness to non-frontal head pose angles, and (c). a strong correlation between its uncertainty estimates and its accuracy."

The Program Evaluation and Review Technique provides a probabilistic framework to model task variability and critical paths. In this paper, the author presents a novel formulation of PERT scheduling as an energy minimization problem within a Hopfield neural network architecture. By mapping task start times and precedence constraints into a neural computation framework, the networks inherent optimization dynamics is exploited to approximate globally consistent schedules. The author addresses key theoretical issues related to energy function differentiability, constraint encoding, and convergence, and extends the Hopfield model for structured precedence graphs. Numerical simulations on synthetic project networks comprising up to 1000 tasks demonstrate the viability of this approach, achieving near optimal makespans with minimal constraint violations. The findings suggest that neural optimization models offer a promising direction for scalable and adaptive project tasks scheduling under uncertainty in areas such as the agentic AI workflows, microservice based applications that the modern AI systems are being built upon."

For several tasks, quantifying the uncertainty of SAM is of particular interest. However, the ambiguous nature of the class-agnostic foundation model SAM challenges current uncertainty quantification (UQ) approaches. This paper presents a theoretically motivated uncertainty quantification model based on a Bayesian entropy formulation jointly respecting aleatoric, epistemic, and the newly introduced task uncertainty. We use this formulation to train USAM, a lightweight post-hoc UQ method. Our model traces the root of uncertainty back to under-parameterised models, insufficient prompts or image ambiguities. Our proposed deterministic USAM demonstrates superior predictive capabilities on the SA-V, MOSE, ADE20k, DAVIS, and COCO datasets, offering a computationally cheap and easy-to-use UQ alternative that can support user-prompting, enhance semi-supervised pipelines, or balance the tradeoff between accuracy and cost efficiency."

Our analysis presents the following insights: i) Compared to LTSSL algorithms trained from scratch, FFT results in a decline in model performance, whereas LP and LFT, although boosting overall model performance, exhibit negligible benefits to tail classes. ii) LP produces numerous false pseudo-labels due to \\textit{underlearned} training data, while LFT can reduce the number of these false labels but becomes overconfident about them owing to \\textit{biased fitting} training data. This exacerbates the pseudo-labeled and classifier biases inherent in LTSSL, limiting performance improvement in the tail classes. With these insights, we propose a Unbiased Lightweight Fine-tuning strategy, \\textbf{ULFine}, which mitigates the overconfidence via confidence-aware adaptive fitting of textual prototypes and counteracts the pseudo-labeled and classifier biases via complementary fusion of dual logits. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ULFine markedly decreases training costs by over ten times and substantially increases prediction accuracies compared to state-of-the-art methods."

Built upon BigCodeBench, CodeMixBench introduces controlled code-mixing (CMD) into the natural language parts of prompts across three language pairs: Hinglish (Hindi-English), Spanish-English, and Chinese Pinyin-English. We comprehensively evaluate a diverse set of open-source code generation models ranging from 1.5B to 15B parameters. Our results show that code-mixed prompts consistently degrade Pass@1 performance compared to their English-only counterparts, with performance drops increasing under higher CMD levels for smaller models. CodeMixBench provides a realistic evaluation framework for studying multilingual code generation and highlights new challenges and directions for building robust code generation models that generalize well across diverse linguistic settings."

To address this, we propose Fine-Grained CLIP (FG-CLIP), which enhances fine-grained understanding through three key innovations. First, we leverage large multimodal models to generate 1.6 billion long caption-image pairs for capturing global-level semantic details. Second, a high-quality dataset is constructed with 12 million images and 40 million region-specific bounding boxes aligned with detailed captions to ensure precise, context-rich representations. Third, 10 million hard fine-grained negative samples are incorporated to improve the model's ability to distinguish subtle semantic differences. Corresponding training methods are meticulously designed for these data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FG-CLIP outperforms the original CLIP and other state-of-the-art methods across various downstream tasks, including fine-grained understanding, open-vocabulary object detection, image-text retrieval, and general multimodal benchmarks.

In this work, we highlight the reproducibility issue in these redefinitions, making comparative benchmarks unfair and unreliable. To address this problem, we propose a unified formulation for visual affordance prediction, provide a comprehensive and systematic review of previous works highlighting strengths and limitations of methods and datasets, and analyse what challenges reproducibility. To favour transparency, we introduce the Affordance Sheet, a document to detail the proposed solution, the datasets, and the validation. As the physical properties of an object influence the interaction with the robot, we present a generic framework that links visual affordance prediction to the physical world. Using the weight of an object as an example for this framework, we discuss how estimating object mass can affect the affordance prediction. Our approach bridges the gap between affordance perception and robot actuation, and accounts for the complete information about objects of interest and how the robot interacts with them to accomplish its task."

Based on the powerful generative capabilities of DDPMs, many previous works adopt additional prompts, such as text embeddings and CLIP image embeddings, to represent the identity information, while they fail to disentangle the identity information and background information. As a result, the generated images not only lose key identity characteristics but also suffer from significantly reduced diversity. To address this issue, previous works have combined the W+ space from StyleGAN with diffusion models, leveraging this space to provide a more accurate and comprehensive representation of identity features through multi-level feature extraction. However, the entanglement of identity and background information in in-the-wild images during training prevents accurate identity localization, resulting in severe semantic interference between identity and background. In this paper, we propose a novel fine-tuning-based diffusion model for personalized identities text-to-image generation, named PIDiff, which leverages the W+ space and an identity-tailored fine-tuning strategy to avoid semantic entanglement and achieves accurate feature extraction and localization. Style editing can also be achieved by PIDiff through preserving the characteristics of identity features in the W+ space, which vary from coarse to fine. Through the combination of the proposed cross-attention block and parameter optimization strategy, PIDiff preserves the identity information and maintains the generation capability for in-the-wild images of the pre-trained model during inference.

Previous efforts have individually targeted these limitations. While information-theoretic Gaussian diffusion models alleviate the suboptimality of variational losses, they still perform modeling in continuous domains. In this work, we introduce the Information-Theoretic Discrete Poisson Diffusion Model (ItDPDM), which simultaneously addresses both limitations by directly operating in a discrete state-space via a Poisson diffusion process inspired by photon arrival processes in camera sensors. We introduce a novel Poisson Reconstruction Loss (PRL) and derive an exact relationship between PRL and the true negative log-likelihood, thereby eliminating the need for approximate evidence lower bounds.

This paper addresses this issue by leveraging Conformal Prediction (CP), which effectively constrains the upper bound of FPRs. While directly applying CP constrains FPRs, it also leads to a significant reduction in detection performance.

Early identification is necessary to prompt intervention, but it remains a challenging task. This study aims to address this challenge by combining joint graph learning with network analysis. Motivated by this discovery, we develop a Conjoint Graph Representation Learning (CGRL) framework that: a) constructs two networks based on disease coding, including the patient network and the disease difference network. Three comorbidity network features were generated based on the basic difference network to capture the potential relationship between comorbidities and risk diseases; b) incorporates computational structure intervention and learning feature representation, CGRL was developed to predict the risks of diabetes and coronary heart disease in patients; and c) analysis the comorbidity patterns and exploring the pathways of disease progression, the pathological pathogenesis of diabetes and coronary heart disease may be revealed. The results show that the network features extracted based on the difference network are important, and the framework we proposed provides more accurate predictions than other strong models in terms of accuracy."

However, FL faces significant challenges due to limited communication resources, statistical heterogeneity, and the need for balanced client participation. This paper proposes an Age of Information (AoI)-based client selection policy that addresses these challenges by minimizing load imbalance through controlled selection intervals. Our method employs a decentralized Markov scheduling policy, allowing clients to independently manage participation based on age-dependent selection probabilities, which balances client updates across training rounds with minimal central oversight. We provide a convergence proof for our method, demonstrating that it ensures stable and efficient model convergence. Specifically, we derive optimal parameters for the Markov selection model to achieve balanced and consistent client participation, highlighting the benefits of AoI in enhancing convergence stability. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that our AoI-based method, particularly the optimal Markov variant, improves convergence over the FedAvg selection approach across both IID and non-IID data settings by $7.5\\%$ and up to $20\\%$. Our findings underscore the effectiveness of AoI-based scheduling for scalable, fair, and efficient FL systems across diverse learning environments."

This task faces significant challenges in scenarios involving overlapping or interacting objects: (1) Inaccurate localization of target objects due to attention misalignment, leading to incomplete or misplaced edits; (2) Attribute-object mismatch, where color or texture changes fail to align with intended regions due to cross-attention leakage, creating semantic conflicts (\\textit{e.g.}, color bleeding into non-target areas). Existing methods struggle with these challenges: approaches relying on global cross-attention mechanisms suffer from attention dilution and spatial interference between objects, while mask-based methods fail to bind attributes to geometrically accurate regions due to feature entanglement in multi-object scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a training-free, inference-stage optimization approach that enables precise localized image manipulation in complex multi-object scenes, named MDE-Edit. MDE-Edit optimizes the noise latent feature in diffusion models via two key losses: Object Alignment Loss (OAL) aligns multi-layer cross-attention with segmentation masks for precise object positioning, and Color Consistency Loss (CCL) amplifies target attribute attention within masks while suppressing leakage to adjacent regions. This dual-loss design ensures localized and coherent multi-object edits. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MDE-Edit outperforms state-of-the-art methods in editing accuracy and visual quality, offering a robust solution for complex multi-object image manipulation tasks."

Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) offer a more nuanced analysis by decomposing the activations of LLMs into sparse linear combination of SAE features. We introduce a novel metric to assess the monolinguality of features obtained from SAEs, discovering that some features are strongly related to specific languages. Additionally, we show that ablating these SAE features only significantly reduces abilities in one language of LLMs, leaving others almost unaffected. Interestingly, we find some languages have multiple synergistic SAE features, and ablating them together yields greater improvement than ablating individually. Moreover, we leverage these SAE-derived language-specific features to enhance steering vectors, achieving control over the language generated by LLMs."

To address this, existing approaches incorporate conservatism by indiscriminately discouraging all OOD actions, thereby hindering the agent's ability to generalize and exploit beneficial ones. In this paper, we propose Advantage-based Diffusion Actor-Critic (ADAC), a novel method that systematically evaluates OOD actions using the batch-optimal value function. Based on this evaluation, ADAC defines an advantage function to modulate the Q-function update, enabling more precise assessment of OOD action quality. We design a custom PointMaze environment and collect datasets to visually reveal that advantage modulation can effectively identify and select superior OOD actions.

Its severity is typically evaluated by estimating the percentage of obstructed airway. This estimation can be obtained from CT data or through visual inspection by experts exploring the region. However, visual inspections are inherently subjective, leading to less consistent and robust diagnoses. No public methods or datasets are currently available for automated evaluation of this condition from bronchoscopy video.\n  Methods: We propose a pipeline for automated subglottic stenosis severity estimation during the bronchoscopy exploration, without requiring the physician to traverse the stenosed region. Our approach exploits the physical effect of illumination decline in endoscopy to segment and track the lumen and obtain a 3D model of the airway. This 3D model is obtained from a single frame and is used to measure the airway narrowing.\n  Results: Our pipeline is the first to enable automated and robust subglottic stenosis severity measurement using bronchoscopy images. The results show consistency with ground-truth estimations from CT scans and expert estimations, and reliable repeatability across multiple estimations on the same patient. Our evaluation is performed on our new Subglottic Stenosis Dataset of real bronchoscopy procedures data.\n  Conclusion: We demonstrate how to automate evaluation of subglottic stenosis severity using only bronchoscopy. Our approach can assist with and shorten diagnosis and monitoring procedures, with automated and repeatable estimations and less exploration time, and save radiation exposure to patients as no CT is required. Additionally, we release the first public benchmark for subglottic stenosis severity assessment."

In this study, we explore the potential of diffusion models for anomaly detection, proposing a novel framework that leverages the strengths of diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) to effectively identify anomalies in both image and audio data. The proposed method models the distribution of normal data through a diffusion process and reconstructs input data via reverse diffusion, using a combination of reconstruction errors and semantic discrepancies as anomaly indicators. To enhance the framework's performance, we introduce multi-scale feature extraction, attention mechanisms, and wavelet-domain representations, enabling the model to capture fine-grained structures and global dependencies in the data. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including MVTec AD and UrbanSound8K, demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art anomaly detection techniques, achieving superior accuracy and robustness across diverse data modalities.

Recent work has suggested that neural networks trained from random initialization find solutions within the same basin modulo permutation, and proposes a method to align trained models within the same loss basin. We hypothesize that misalignment of basins is the reason why LTH masks do not generalize to new random initializations and propose permuting the LTH mask to align with the new optimization basin when performing sparse training from a different random init. We empirically show a significant increase in generalization when sparse training from random initialization with the permuted mask as compared to using the non-permuted LTH mask, on multiple datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet) and models (VGG11, ResNet20 and ResNet50)."

To study this, we consider a structured family of few-shot learning tasks for which the true prediction rule is to add an integer $k$ to the input. We find that Llama-3-8B attains high accuracy on this task for a range of $k$, and localize its few-shot ability to just three attention heads via a novel optimization approach. We further show the extracted signals lie in a six-dimensional subspace, where four of the dimensions track the unit digit and the other two dimensions track overall magnitude. We finally examine how these heads extract information from individual few-shot examples, identifying a self-correction mechanism in which mistakes from earlier examples are suppressed by later examples.

Existing approaches tackle this by learning probabilistic embeddings during VLM training, which demands large datasets and does not leverage the powerful representations already learned by large-scale VLMs like CLIP. In this paper, we propose GroVE, a post-hoc approach to obtaining probabilistic embeddings from frozen VLMs. GroVE builds on Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model (GPLVM) to learn a shared low-dimensional latent space where image and text inputs are mapped to a unified representation, optimized through single-modal embedding reconstruction and cross-modal alignment objectives.

One key feature of this problem is that each agent's valuation for each item can only be observed through the semi-bandit feedback, while existing work supposes that the item values are provided at the beginning of each round. Another key feature is that the algorithm's reward function is not additive with respect to rounds, unlike most bandit-setting problems.\n  Our first contribution is to propose an algorithm that has an asymptotic regret bound of $O(m\\sqrt{T}\\ln T/n + m\\sqrt{T \\ln(mnT)})$, where $n$ is the number of agents, $m$ is the number of items, and $T$ is the time horizon.

In this direction, one typical paradigm evaluates model performance separately on known classes (i.e., base domain) and unseen classes (i.e., new domain). However, real-world scenarios require models to handle inputs without prior domain knowledge. This practical challenge has spurred the development of open-world prompt tuning, which demands a unified evaluation of two stages: 1) detecting whether an input belongs to the base or new domain (P1), and 2) classifying the sample into its correct class (P2). What's more, as domain distributions are generally unknown, a proper metric should be insensitive to varying base/new sample ratios (P3). However, we find that current metrics, including HM, overall accuracy, and AUROC, fail to satisfy these three properties simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we propose OpenworldAUC, a unified metric that jointly assesses detection and classification through pairwise instance comparisons. To optimize OpenworldAUC effectively, we introduce Gated Mixture-of-Prompts (GMoP), which employs domain-specific prompts and a gating mechanism to dynamically balance detection and classification. Theoretical guarantees ensure generalization of GMoP under practical conditions. Experiments on 15 benchmarks in open-world scenarios show GMoP achieves SOTA performance on OpenworldAUC and other metrics. We release the code at https://github.com/huacong/OpenworldAUC"

SVP treats layer activations as latent variables and optimizes local Evidence Lower Bounds (ELBOs), enabling independent, local updates while preserving global coherence. However, directly applying KL divergence in layer-wise ELBOs risks inter-layer's representation collapse due to excessive compression. To prevent this, SVP projects activations into low-dimensional spaces via fixed random matrices, ensuring information preservation and representational diversity. Combined with a feature alignment loss for inter-layer consistency, SVP achieves competitive accuracy with BP across diverse architectures (MLPs, CNNs, Transformers) and datasets (MNIST to ImageNet), reduces memory usage by up to 4x, and significantly improves scalability.

While previous studies have revealed that strong light sources often introduce flare artifacts in the captured image, which degrade the image quality, the impact of flare on object detection performance remains unclear. In this research, we unveil PaniCar, a digital phenomenon that causes an object detector's confidence score to fluctuate below detection thresholds when exposed to activated emergency vehicle lighting. This vulnerability poses a significant safety risk, and can cause autonomous vehicles to fail to detect objects near emergency vehicles. In addition, this vulnerability could be exploited by adversaries to compromise the security of advanced driving assistance systems (ADASs). We assess seven commercial ADASs (Tesla Model 3, \"manufacturer C\", HP, Pelsee, AZDOME, Imagebon, Rexing), four object detectors (YOLO, SSD, RetinaNet, Faster R-CNN), and 14 patterns of emergency vehicle lighting to understand the influence of various technical and environmental factors. We also evaluate four SOTA flare removal methods and show that their performance and latency are insufficient for real-time driving constraints. To mitigate this risk, we propose Caracetamol, a robust framework designed to enhance the resilience of object detectors against the effects of activated emergency vehicle lighting. Our evaluation shows that on YOLOv3 and Faster RCNN, Caracetamol improves the models' average confidence of car detection by 0.20, the lower confidence bound by 0.33, and reduces the fluctuation range by 0.33. In addition, Caracetamol is capable of processing frames at a rate of between 30-50 FPS, enabling real-time ADAS car detection."

However, most of the current prompt learning methods only used the text prompts and ignored the particular structures (such as the complex anatomical structures and subtle pathological features) in the biomedical images. In this work, we propose Biomed-DPT, a knowledge-enhanced dual modality prompt tuning technique. In designing the text prompt, Biomed-DPT constructs a dual prompt including the template-driven clinical prompts and the large language model (LLM)-driven domain-adapted prompts, then extracts the clinical knowledge from the domain-adapted prompts through the knowledge distillation technique. In designing the vision prompt, Biomed-DPT introduces the zero vector as a soft prompt to leverage attention re-weighting so that the focus on non-diagnostic regions and the recognition of non-critical pathological features are avoided. Biomed-DPT achieves an average classification accuracy of 66.14\\% across 11 biomedical image datasets covering 9 modalities and 10 organs, with performance reaching 78.06\\% in base classes and 75.97\\% in novel classes, surpassing the Context Optimization (CoOp) method by 6.20\\%, 3.78\\%, and 8.04\\%, respectively.

The robustness of these watermarking algorithms has become a key factor in evaluating their effectiveness. Current text watermarking algorithms embed watermarks in high-entropy tokens to ensure text quality. In this paper, we reveal that this seemingly benign design can be exploited by attackers, posing a significant risk to the robustness of the watermark. We introduce a generic efficient paraphrasing attack, the Self-Information Rewrite Attack (SIRA), which leverages the vulnerability by calculating the self-information of each token to identify potential pattern tokens and perform targeted attack. Our work exposes a widely prevalent vulnerability in current watermarking algorithms. The experimental results show SIRA achieves nearly 100% attack success rates on seven recent watermarking methods with only 0.88 USD per million tokens cost. Our approach does not require any access to the watermark algorithms or the watermarked LLM and can seamlessly transfer to any LLM as the attack model, even mobile-level models. Our findings highlight the urgent need for more robust watermarking."

In existing methods, several ideal assumptions, e.g. latent unconfoundedness assumption or additive equi-confounding bias assumption, are proposed to address the latent confounder problem raised by the observational data. However, in real-world applications, these assumptions are typically violated which limits their practical effectiveness. In this paper, we tackle the problem of estimating the long-term individual causal effects without the aforementioned assumptions. Specifically, we propose to utilize the natural heterogeneity of data, such as data from multiple sources, to identify latent confounders, thereby significantly avoiding reliance on idealized assumptions. Practically, we devise a latent representation learning-based estimator of long-term causal effects. Theoretically, we establish the identifiability of latent confounders, with which we further achieve long-term effect identification. Extensive experimental studies, conducted on multiple synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method."

To address these limitations and improve the robustness of CBMs, we propose the Concept-based Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (CUDA) framework. CUDA is designed to: (1) align concept representations across domains using adversarial training, (2) introduce a relaxation threshold to allow minor domain-specific differences in concept distributions, thereby preventing performance drop due to over-constraints of these distributions, (3) infer concepts directly in the target domain without requiring labeled concept data, enabling CBMs to adapt to diverse domains, and (4) integrate concept learning into conventional domain adaptation (DA) with theoretical guarantees, improving interpretability and establishing new benchmarks for DA.

In this work, we introduce Enhancing Anything Model (EAM), a novel BSR method that leverages DiT and outperforms previous U-Net-based approaches. We introduce a novel block, $\\Psi$-DiT, which effectively guides the DiT to enhance image restoration. This block employs a low-resolution latent as a separable flow injection control, forming a triple-flow architecture that effectively leverages the prior knowledge embedded in the pre-trained DiT. To fully exploit the prior guidance capabilities of T2I models and enhance their generalization in BSR, we introduce a progressive Masked Image Modeling strategy, which also reduces training costs. Additionally, we propose a subject-aware prompt generation strategy that employs a robust multi-modal model in an in-context learning framework. This strategy automatically identifies key image areas, provides detailed descriptions, and optimizes the utilization of T2I diffusion priors.

We propose a novel active learning framework where resource allocation patterns are drawn sequentially, evaluated in the environment, and then used to iteratively update a surrogate model of the environment.

Latte enables general knowledge-guided downstream tabular learning, facilitating the weighted fusion of information across different feature values while reducing the risk of overfitting to limited labeled data. Furthermore, Latte is compatible with existing unsupervised pre-training paradigms and effectively utilizes available unlabeled samples to overcome the performance limitations imposed by an extremely small labeled dataset.

Therefore, it becomes essential to actively incorporate more high-quality labeled data, all while adhering to a constrained labeling budget. To enable data-efficient treatment effect estimation, we formalize the problem through rigorous theoretical analysis within the active learning context, where the derived key measures -- \\textit{factual} and \\textit{counterfactual covering radius} determine the risk upper bound. To reduce the bound, we propose a greedy radius reduction algorithm, which excels under an idealized, balanced data distribution. To generalize to more realistic data distributions, we further propose FCCM, which transforms the optimization objective into the \\textit{Factual} and \\textit{Counterfactual Coverage Maximization} to ensure effective radius reduction during data acquisition.

To this end, we propose a novel state modelling framework for cooperative MARL, where agents infer meaningful belief representations of the non-observable state, with respect to optimizing their own policies, while filtering redundant and less informative joint state information. Building upon this framework, we propose the MARL SMPE algorithm. In SMPE, agents enhance their own policy's discriminative abilities under partial observability, explicitly by incorporating their beliefs into the policy network, and implicitly by adopting an adversarial type of exploration policies which encourages agents to discover novel, high-value states while improving the discriminative abilities of others.

The table tagging method is a popular approach to addressing this task, which encodes a sentence into a 2-dimensional table, allowing for the tagging of relations between any two words. Previous efforts have focused on designing various downstream relation learning modules to better capture interactions between tokens in the table, revealing that a stronger capability to capture relations can lead to greater improvements in the model. Motivated by this, we attempt to directly utilize transformer layers as downstream relation learning modules. Due to the powerful semantic modeling capability of transformers, it is foreseeable that this will lead to excellent improvement. However, owing to the quadratic relation between the length of the table and the length of the input sentence sequence, using transformers directly faces two challenges: overly long table sequences and unfair local attention interaction. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Table-Transformer (T-T) for the tagging-based ASTE method. Specifically, we introduce a stripe attention mechanism with a loop-shift strategy to tackle these challenges. The former modifies the global attention mechanism to only attend to a 2-dimensional local attention window, while the latter facilitates interaction between different attention windows. Extensive and comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the T-T, as a downstream relation learning module, achieves state-of-the-art performance with lower computational costs."

Nevertheless, the paradigm has recently shifted towards multi-task data and multi-task learning (MTL), targeting generalist and foundation models that can handle multiple tasks simultaneously. Despite their growing importance, MTL data and models have been largely neglected while pursuing unlearnable strategies. This paper presents MTL-UE, the first unified framework for generating unlearnable examples for multi-task data and MTL models. Instead of optimizing perturbations for each sample, we design a generator-based structure that introduces label priors and class-wise feature embeddings which leads to much better attacking performance. In addition, MTL-UE incorporates intra-task and inter-task embedding regularization to increase inter-class separation and suppress intra-class variance which enhances the attack robustness greatly. Furthermore, MTL-UE is versatile with good supports for dense prediction tasks in MTL. It is also plug-and-play allowing integrating existing surrogate-dependent unlearnable methods with little adaptation. Extensive experiments show that MTL-UE achieves superior attacking performance consistently across 4 MTL datasets, 3 base UE methods, 5 model backbones, and 5 MTL task-weighting strategies."

        "summary": "arXiv:2505.05295v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Model monitoring is a critical component of the machine learning lifecycle, safeguarding against undetected drops in the model's performance after deployment. Traditionally, performance monitoring has required access to ground truth labels, which are not always readily available. This can result in unacceptable latency or render performance monitoring altogether impossible. Recently, methods designed to estimate the accuracy of classifier models without access to labels have shown promising results. However, there are various other metrics that might be more suitable for assessing model performance in many cases. Until now, none of these important metrics has received similar interest from the scientific community. In this work, we address this gap by presenting CBPE, a novel method that can estimate any binary classification metric defined using the confusion matrix. In particular, we choose four metrics from this large family: accuracy, precision, recall, and F$_1$, to demonstrate our method. CBPE treats the elements of the confusion matrix as random variables and leverages calibrated confidence scores of the model to estimate their distributions. The desired metric is then also treated as a random variable, whose full probability distribution can be derived from the estimated confusion matrix. CBPE is shown to produce estimates that come with strong theoretical guarantees and valid confidence intervals."

We propose Elastic Reasoning, a novel framework for scalable chain of thoughts that explicitly separates reasoning into two phases--thinking and solution--with independently allocated budgets. At test time, Elastic Reasoning prioritize that completeness of solution segments, significantly improving reliability under tight resource constraints. To train models that are robust to truncated thinking, we introduce a lightweight budget-constrained rollout strategy, integrated into GRPO, which teaches the model to reason adaptively when the thinking process is cut short and generalizes effectively to unseen budget constraints without additional training. Empirical results on mathematical (AIME, MATH500) and programming (LiveCodeBench, Codeforces) benchmarks demonstrate that Elastic Reasoning performs robustly under strict budget constraints, while incurring significantly lower training cost than baseline methods. Remarkably, our approach also produces more concise and efficient reasoning even in unconstrained settings. Elastic Reasoning offers a principled and practical solution to the pressing challenge of controllable reasoning at scale."

In this paper, we propose In-context Learning for Contribution Measurement (ICon), a novel gradient-free method that takes advantage of the implicit fine-tuning nature of in-context learning (ICL) to measure sample contribution without gradient computation or manual indicators engineering. ICon offers a computationally efficient alternative to gradient-based methods and reduces human inductive bias inherent in heuristic-based approaches. ICon comprises three components and identifies high-contribution data by assessing performance shifts under implicit learning through ICL. Extensive experiments on three LLMs across 12 benchmarks and 5 pairwise evaluation sets demonstrate the effectiveness of ICon. Remarkably, on LLaMA3.1-8B, models trained on 15% of ICon-selected data outperform full datasets by 5.42% points and exceed the best performance of widely used selection methods by 2.06% points. We further analyze high-contribution samples selected by ICon, which show both diverse tasks and appropriate difficulty levels, rather than just the hardest ones."

Furthermore, our research shows a prevailing bias in current databases, which include mostly beautiful images, further complicating the study and prediction of aesthetic responses. We address these limitations by creating a database of images with minimal semantic content and devising, and next exploiting, a method to generate images on the ugly side of aesthetic valuations. The resulting Minimum Semantic Content (MSC) database consists of a large and balanced collection of 10,426 images, each evaluated by 100 observers. We next use established image metrics to demonstrate how augmenting an image set biased towards beautiful images with ugly images can modify, or even invert, an observed relationship between image features and aesthetics valuation. Taken together, our study reveals that works in empirical aesthetics attempting to link image content and aesthetic judgements may magnify, underestimate, or simply miss interesting effects due to a limitation of the range of aesthetic values they consider."

Compared to vision-based systems, full-body pose estimation from sparse tracking signals is not limited by environmental conditions or recording range. However, previous works either face the challenge of wearing additional sensors on the pelvis and lower-body or rely on external visual sensors to obtain global positions of key joints. To improve the practicality of the technology for virtual reality applications, we estimate full-body poses using only inertial data obtained from three Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors worn on the head and wrists, thereby reducing the complexity of the hardware system. In this work, we propose a method called Progressive Inertial Poser (ProgIP) for human pose estimation, which combines neural network estimation with a human dynamics model, considers the hierarchical structure of the kinematic chain, and employs a multi-stage progressive network estimation with increased depth to reconstruct full-body motion in real time. The encoder combines Transformer Encoder and bidirectional LSTM (TE-biLSTM) to flexibly capture the temporal dependencies of the inertial sequence, while the decoder based on multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) transforms high-dimensional features and accurately projects them onto Skinned Multi-Person Linear (SMPL) model parameters. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results on multiple public datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods with the same inputs, and is comparable to recent works using six IMU sensors."

Our findings show that alignment knowledge of pre-trained multimodal foundation model enables our method to generate more complete and compact localization for sounding objects.

This synergistic design enables gradual resolution enhancement from 10m to 1m while preserving fine-grained spatial textures, and ensures high classification fidelity through effective cross-scale feature fusion. This method has been successfully applied to the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB), a region characterized by complex urban-rural patterns and diverse topography. As a result, a comprehensive ISA mapping product for 2021, referred to as ISA-1, was generated, covering an area of over 2.2 million square kilometers.

In densely urbanized areas (e.g., Suzhou, Nanjing), ISA-1 reduces ISA overestimation through improved discrimination of green spaces and water bodies. Conversely, in mountainous regions (e.g., Ganzi, Zhaotong), it identifies significantly more ISA due to its enhanced ability to detect fragmented anthropogenic features such as rural roads and sparse settlements, demonstrating its robustness across diverse landscapes.

However, accurately recovering hair strands from raw scan data remains challenging due to human hair's complex and fine-grained structure. Existing methods typically rely on RGB captures, which can be sensitive to the environment and can be a challenging domain for extracting the orientation of guiding strands, especially in the case of challenging hairstyles. To reconstruct the hair purely from the observed geometry, our method finds sharp surface features directly on the scan and estimates strand orientation through a neural 2D line detector applied to the renderings of scan shading. Additionally, we incorporate a diffusion prior trained on a diverse set of synthetic hair scans, refined with an improved noise schedule, and adapted to the reconstructed contents via a scan-specific text prompt. We demonstrate that this combination of supervision signals enables accurate reconstruction of both simple and intricate hairstyles without relying on color information.

To address this, we propose the Hybrid State-space Block (HSB) to obtain the local-global context of roadside point cloud. Specifically, it enhances neighborhood connections through local convolution and preserves historical memory through residual attention. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the popular large scale roadside benchmark: DAIR-V2X-I. The code will be released soon."

However, methods that rely on exhaustive search to find oblique splits face computational challenges. As a result, they have not been widely explored. We introduce a novel algorithm, Classification and Regression Tree - Exhaustive Linear Combinations (CART-ELC), for inducing oblique decision trees that performs an exhaustive search on a restricted set of hyperplanes. We then investigate the algorithm's computational complexity and its predictive capabilities. Our results demonstrate that CART-ELC consistently achieves competitive performance on small datasets, often yielding statistically significant improvements in classification accuracy relative to existing decision tree induction algorithms, while frequently producing shallower, simpler, and thus more interpretable trees."

With the rise of large language models in automated news and content creation, there is growing concern that these systems may introduce or even amplify framing biases compared to human authors. In this paper, we explore how framing manifests in both out-of-the-box and fine-tuned LLM-generated news content. Our analysis reveals that, particularly in politically and socially sensitive contexts, LLMs tend to exhibit more pronounced framing than their human counterparts. In addition, we observe significant variation in framing tendencies across different model architectures, with some models displaying notably higher biases. These findings point to the need for effective post-training mitigation strategies and tighter evaluation frameworks to ensure that automated news content upholds the standards of balanced reporting."

First, we find that scaling up inference compute for English-centric reasoning language models (RLMs) improves multilingual mathematical reasoning across many languages including low-resource languages, to an extent where they outperform models twice their size. Second, we reveal that while English-centric RLM's CoTs are naturally predominantly English, they consistently follow a quote-and-think pattern to reason about quoted non-English inputs. Third, we discover an effective strategy to control the language of long CoT reasoning, and we observe that models reason better and more efficiently in high-resource languages. Finally, we observe poor out-of-domain reasoning generalization, in particular from STEM to cultural commonsense knowledge, even for English. Overall, we demonstrate the potentials, study the mechanisms and outline the limitations of crosslingual generalization of English reasoning test-time scaling. We conclude that practitioners should let English-centric RLMs reason in high-resource languages, while further work is needed to improve reasoning in low-resource languages and out-of-domain contexts."

For transformers, however, recent work reported weak correlation between flatness and generalization. We argue that existing sharpness measures fail for transformers, because they have much richer symmetries in their attention mechanism that induce directions in parameter space along which the network or its loss remain identical. We posit that sharpness must account fully for these symmetries, and thus we redefine it on a quotient manifold that results from quotienting out the transformer symmetries, thereby removing their ambiguities. Leveraging tools from Riemannian geometry, we propose a fully general notion of sharpness, in terms of a geodesic ball on the symmetry-corrected quotient manifold. In practice, we need to resort to approximating the geodesics. Doing so up to first order yields existing adaptive sharpness measures, and we demonstrate that including higher-order terms is crucial to recover correlation with generalization. We present results on diagonal networks with synthetic data, and show that our geodesic sharpness reveals strong correlation for real-world transformers on both text and image classification tasks."

However, the effectiveness of such monitoring hinges on CoTs faithfully representing models' actual reasoning processes. We evaluate CoT faithfulness of state-of-the-art reasoning models across 6 reasoning hints presented in the prompts and find: (1) for most settings and models tested, CoTs reveal their usage of hints in at least 1% of examples where they use the hint, but the reveal rate is often below 20%, (2) outcome-based reinforcement learning initially improves faithfulness but plateaus without saturating, and (3) when reinforcement learning increases how frequently hints are used (reward hacking), the propensity to verbalize them does not increase, even without training against a CoT monitor. These results suggest that CoT monitoring is a promising way of noticing undesired behaviors during training and evaluations, but that it is not sufficient to rule them out. They also suggest that in settings like ours where CoT reasoning is not necessary, test-time monitoring of CoTs is unlikely to reliably catch rare and catastrophic unexpected behaviors."

However, current HDC-based applications often rely on high-precision models and/or encoding matrices to achieve competitive performance, which imposes significant computational and memory demands, especially for ultra-low power devices. While recent efforts use techniques like precision reduction and pruning to increase the efficiency, most require retraining to maintain performance, making them expensive and impractical. To address this issue, we propose a novel Post Training Compression algorithm, Decomposition-Pruning-Quantization (DPQ-HD), which aims at compressing the end-to-end HDC system, achieving near floating point performance without the need of retraining. DPQ-HD reduces computational and memory overhead by uniquely combining the above three compression techniques and efficiently adapts to hardware constraints. Additionally, we introduce an energy-efficient inference approach that progressively evaluates similarity scores such as cosine similarity and performs early exit to reduce the computation, accelerating prediction inference while maintaining accuracy. We demonstrate that DPQ-HD achieves up to 20-100x reduction in memory for image and graph classification tasks with only a 1-2% drop in accuracy compared to uncompressed workloads. Lastly, we show that DPQ-HD outperforms the existing post-training compression methods and performs better or at par with retraining-based state-of-the-art techniques, requiring significantly less overall optimization time (up to 100x) and faster inference (up to 56x) on a microcontroller"

In this paper, we introduce TokLIP, a visual tokenizer that enhances comprehension by semanticizing vector-quantized (VQ) tokens and incorporating CLIP-level semantics while enabling end-to-end multimodal autoregressive training with standard VQ tokens. TokLIP integrates a low-level discrete VQ tokenizer with a ViT-based token encoder to capture high-level continuous semantics. Unlike previous approaches (e.g., VILA-U) that discretize high-level features, TokLIP disentangles training objectives for comprehension and generation, allowing the direct application of advanced VQ tokenizers without the need for tailored quantization operations. Our empirical results demonstrate that TokLIP achieves exceptional data efficiency, empowering visual tokens with high-level semantic understanding while enhancing low-level generative capacity, making it well-suited for autoregressive Transformers in both comprehension and generation tasks.

In the long run, this bias could result in a permanent decline in translation quality and cultural authenticity. In response to the urgent need for a specialized literary evaluation metric, we introduce TransProQA, a novel, reference-free, LLM-based question-answering (QA) framework designed specifically for literary translation evaluation. TransProQA uniquely integrates insights from professional literary translators and researchers, focusing on critical elements in literary quality assessment such as literary devices, cultural understanding, and authorial voice. Our extensive evaluation shows that while literary-finetuned XCOMET-XL yields marginal gains, TransProQA substantially outperforms current metrics, achieving up to 0.07 gain in correlation (ACC-EQ and Kendall's tau) and surpassing the best state-of-the-art (SOTA) metrics by over 15 points in adequacy assessments. Incorporating professional translator insights as weights further improves performance, highlighting the value of translator inputs. Notably, TransProQA approaches human-level evaluation performance comparable to trained linguistic annotators. It demonstrates broad applicability to open-source models such as LLaMA3.3-70b and Qwen2.5-32b, indicating its potential as an accessible and training-free literary evaluation metric and a valuable tool for evaluating texts that require local processing due to copyright or ethical considerations."

However, it still faces two main challenges: (1) the lack of an efficient data verification strategy makes it difficult to provide timely feedback on data quality; and (2) the selection of seed data for training classifiers lacks clear criteria and relies heavily on human expertise, introducing a degree of subjectivity. To address the first challenge, we introduce an efficient verification strategy that enables rapid evaluation of the impact of data on LLM training with minimal computational cost. To tackle the second challenge, we build upon the assumption that high-quality seed data is beneficial for LLM training, and by integrating the proposed verification strategy, we optimize the selection of positive and negative samples and propose an efficient data filtering pipeline. This pipeline not only improves filtering efficiency, classifier quality, and robustness, but also significantly reduces experimental and inference costs. In addition, to efficiently filter high-quality data, we employ a lightweight classifier based on fastText, and successfully apply the filtering pipeline to two widely-used pre-training corpora, FineWeb and Chinese FineWeb datasets, resulting in the creation of the higher-quality Ultra-FineWeb dataset. Ultra-FineWeb contains approximately 1 trillion English tokens and 120 billion Chinese tokens. Empirical results demonstrate that the LLMs trained on Ultra-FineWeb exhibit significant performance improvements across multiple benchmark tasks, validating the effectiveness of our pipeline in enhancing both data quality and training efficiency."

While supervised learning remains the standard method, reinforcement learning (RL) offers unique advantages through its sequential decision-making framework, which naturally fits the iterative nature of data assimilation by dynamically balancing model forecasts with observations. We develop RL-DAUNCE, a new RL-based method that enhances data assimilation with physical constraints through three key aspects. First, RL-DAUNCE inherits the computational efficiency of machine learning while it uniquely structures its agents to mirror ensemble members in conventional data assimilation methods. Second, RL-DAUNCE emphasizes uncertainty quantification by advancing multiple ensemble members, moving beyond simple mean-state optimization. Third, RL-DAUNCE's ensemble-as-agents design facilitates the enforcement of physical constraints during the assimilation process, which is crucial to improving the state estimation and subsequent forecasting. A primal-dual optimization strategy is developed to enforce constraints, which dynamically penalizes the reward function to ensure constraint satisfaction throughout the learning process. Also, state variable bounds are respected by constraining the RL action space. Together, these features ensure physical consistency without sacrificing efficiency. RL-DAUNCE is applied to the Madden-Julian Oscillation, an intermittent atmospheric phenomenon characterized by strongly non-Gaussian features and multiple physical constraints. RL-DAUNCE outperforms the standard ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), which fails catastrophically due to the violation of physical constraints. Notably, RL-DAUNCE matches the performance of constrained EnKF, particularly in recovering intermittent signals, capturing extreme events, and quantifying uncertainties, while requiring substantially less computational effort."

In this work, we explore to compose perception and reasoning through model merging that connects parameters of different models. Unlike previous works that often focus on merging models of the same kind, we propose merging models across modalities, enabling the incorporation of the reasoning capabilities of LLMs into VLMs. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that model merging offers a successful pathway to transfer reasoning abilities from LLMs to VLMs in a training-free manner. Moreover, we utilize the merged models to understand the internal mechanism of perception and reasoning and how merging affects it. We find that perception capabilities are predominantly encoded in the early layers of the model, whereas reasoning is largely facilitated by the middle-to-late layers. After merging, we observe that all layers begin to contribute to reasoning, whereas the distribution of perception abilities across layers remains largely unchanged. These observations shed light on the potential of model merging as a tool for multimodal integration and interpretation."

Extensive experiments show that StreamBridge significantly improves the streaming understanding capabilities of offline Video-LLMs across various tasks, outperforming even proprietary models such as GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro. Simultaneously, it achieves competitive or superior performance on standard video understanding benchmarks."

To achieve this, we construct a large-scale, physically stable dataset of LEGO designs, along with their associated captions, and train an autoregressive large language model to predict the next brick to add via next-token prediction. To improve the stability of the resulting designs, we employ an efficient validity check and physics-aware rollback during autoregressive inference, which prunes infeasible token predictions using physics laws and assembly constraints. Our experiments show that LegoGPT produces stable, diverse, and aesthetically pleasing LEGO designs that align closely with the input text prompts. We also develop a text-based LEGO texturing method to generate colored and textured designs. We show that our designs can be assembled manually by humans and automatically by robotic arms. We also release our new dataset, StableText2Lego, containing over 47,000 LEGO structures of over 28,000 unique 3D objects accompanied by detailed captions, along with our code and models at the project website: https://avalovelace1.github.io/LegoGPT/."

Empirically, Flow-GRPO is effective across multiple text-to-image tasks. For complex compositions, RL-tuned SD3.5 generates nearly perfect object counts, spatial relations, and fine-grained attributes, boosting GenEval accuracy from $63\\%$ to $95\\%$. In visual text rendering, its accuracy improves from $59\\%$ to $92\\%$, significantly enhancing text generation. Flow-GRPO also achieves substantial gains in human preference alignment. Notably, little to no reward hacking occurred, meaning rewards did not increase at the cost of image quality or diversity, and both remained stable in our experiments."

In this paper, we present Mogao, a unified framework that advances this paradigm by enabling interleaved multi-modal generation through a causal approach. Mogao integrates a set of key technical improvements in architecture design, including a deep-fusion design, dual vision encoders, interleaved rotary position embeddings, and multi-modal classifier-free guidance, which allow it to harness the strengths of both autoregressive models for text generation and diffusion models for high-quality image synthesis. These practical improvements also make Mogao particularly effective to process interleaved sequences of text and images arbitrarily. To further unlock the potential of unified models, we introduce an efficient training strategy on a large-scale, in-house dataset specifically curated for joint text and image generation. Extensive experiments show that Mogao not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-modal understanding and text-to-image generation, but also excels in producing high-quality, coherent interleaved outputs. Its emergent capabilities in zero-shot image editing and compositional generation highlight Mogao as a practical omni-modal foundation model, paving the way for future development and scaling the unified multi-modal systems."

Recent advances in deep generative models (e.g., GANs, diffusion models) and 3D representations (e.g., NeRF, 3D Gaussians) have enabled the learning of real-world scene distributions, improving fidelity, diversity, and view consistency. Recent advances like diffusion models bridge 3D scene synthesis and photorealism by reframing generation as image or video synthesis problems. This survey provides a systematic overview of state-of-the-art approaches, organizing them into four paradigms: procedural generation, neural 3D-based generation, image-based generation, and video-based generation. We analyze their technical foundations, trade-offs, and representative results, and review commonly used datasets, evaluation protocols, and downstream applications. We conclude by discussing key challenges in generation capacity, 3D representation, data and annotations, and evaluation, and outline promising directions including higher fidelity, physics-aware and interactive generation, and unified perception-generation models.

Current approaches face a clear limitation: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods produce high-quality results but require multiple views or video sequences, while video diffusion models can generate animations from single images but struggle with consistency and identity preservation. We present SVAD, a novel approach that addresses these limitations by leveraging complementary strengths of existing techniques. Our method generates synthetic training data through video diffusion, enhances it with identity preservation and image restoration modules, and utilizes this refined data to train 3DGS avatars. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that SVAD outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) single-image methods in maintaining identity consistency and fine details across novel poses and viewpoints, while enabling real-time rendering capabilities. Through our data augmentation pipeline, we overcome the dependency on dense monocular or multi-view training data typically required by traditional 3DGS approaches. Extensive quantitative, qualitative comparisons show our method achieves superior performance across multiple metrics against baseline models. By effectively combining the generative power of diffusion models with both the high-quality results and rendering efficiency of 3DGS, our work establishes a new approach for high-fidelity avatar generation from a single image input."

We therefore propose a data-driven approach to extract probabilistically-independent sources from electronic health record (EHR) data and create a 10-year risk-predictive model for CS in migraine patients. These sources represent external latent variables acting on the causal graph constructed from the EHR data and approximate root causes of CS in our population. A random forest model trained on patient expressions of these sources demonstrated good accuracy (ROC 0.771) and identified the top 10 most predictive sources of CS in migraine patients. These sources revealed that pharmacologic interventions were the most important factor in minimizing CS risk in our population and identified a factor related to allergic rhinitis as a potential causative source of CS in migraine patients."

CTO surpasses existing methods in terms of segmentation accuracy and strikes a better balance between accuracy and efficiency, without the need for additional data inputs or label injections. Specifically, CTO adheres to the canonical encoder-decoder network paradigm, with a dual-stream encoder network comprising a mainstream CNN stream for capturing local features and an auxiliary StitchViT stream for integrating long-range dependencies. Furthermore, to enhance the model's ability to learn boundary areas, we introduce a boundary-guided decoder network that employs binary boundary masks generated by dedicated edge detection operators to provide explicit guidance during the decoding process. We validate the performance of CTO through extensive experiments conducted on seven challenging medical image segmentation datasets, namely ISIC 2016, PH2, ISIC 2018, CoNIC, LiTS17, and BTCV.

The 13th International Workshop on Theorem Proving Components for Educational Software (ThEdu'24), was a satellite event of the CADE29, part of IJCAR 2024, Nancy, France. ThEdu'24 was a vibrant workshop, with one invited talk by Jeremy Avigad (Carnegie Mellon University) and 14 submitted talks. An open call for papers was then issued and attracted 9 submissions. Eight of those submissions have been accepted by our reviewers. The resulting revised papers are collected in the present volume. The contributions in this volume are a faithful representation of the wide spectrum of ThEdu, ranging from those more focused on the automated deduction research, not losing track of the possible applications in an educational setting, to those focused on the applications, in educational settings, of automated deduction tools and methods. We, the volume editors, hope that this collection of papers will further promote the development of theorem-proving-based software and that it will allow to improve the mutual understanding between computer scientists, mathematicians, and stakeholders in education.

RCs are particularly useful to study as they are known to confabulate in a well-defined way: when RCs are trained to reconstruct the dynamics of a given attractor, they sometimes construct an attractor that they were not trained to construct, a so-called `untrained attractor' (UA). This paper sheds light on the role played by UAs when reconstruction fails and their influence when modelling transitions between reconstructed attractors. Based on our results, we conclude that UAs are an intrinsic feature of learning systems whose state spaces are bounded, and that this means of confabulation may be present in systems beyond RCs."

We leverage the intermediate activations of a pre-trained foundation model (CLIP) to guide our optimization process. We divide our optimization into two phases: one for capturing the coarse geometry of the shape, and the other for representing fine-grained features. Our second phase supervision is spatially guided by a novel localized keypoint loss. This spatial guidance enables user control over abstracted features. We ensure fidelity to the original surface through a neural SDF loss, which allows the curves to be used as intuitive deformation handles. We successfully apply our method for shape abstraction over a broad dataset of shapes with varying complexity, geometric structure, and texture, and demonstrate downstream applications for feature control and shape deformation."

Yet, the idea that action-values are explicitly represented has been extensively debated. Critics had therefore repeatedly suggested that policy-gradient (PG) models should be favored over value-based (VB) ones, as a potential solution for this dilemma. Here we argue that this solution is unsatisfying. This is because PG methods are not, in fact, \"Value-free\" -- while they do not rely on an explicit representation of Value for acting (stimulus-response mapping), they do require it for learning. Hence, switching to PG models is, per se, insufficient for eliminating Value from models of behavior. More broadly, the requirement for a representation of Value stems from the underlying assumptions regarding the optimization objective posed by the standard RL framework, not from the particular algorithm chosen to solve it. Previous studies mostly took these standard RL assumptions for granted, as part of their conceptualization or problem modeling, while debating the different methods used to optimize it (i.e., PG or VB). We propose that, instead, the focus of the debate should shift to critically evaluating the underlying modeling assumptions. Such evaluation is particularly important from an experimental perspective. Indeed, the very notion of Value must be reconsidered when standard assumptions (e.g., risk neutrality, full-observability, Markovian environment, exponential discounting) are relaxed, as is likely in natural settings. Finally, we use the Value debate as a case study to argue in favor of a more nuanced, algorithmic rather than statistical, view of what constitutes \"a model\" in cognitive sciences. Our analysis suggests that besides \"parametric\" statistical complexity, additional aspects such as computational complexity must also be taken into account when evaluating model complexity."

Instead, we generate large-scale scene data using procedural models that approximate realistic environments for robotic manipulation, and adapt it to task-specific goals. We do this by training a unified diffusion-based generative model that predicts which objects to place from a fixed asset library, along with their SE(3) poses. This model serves as a flexible scene prior that can be adapted using reinforcement learning-based post training, conditional generation, or inference-time search, steering generation toward downstream objectives even when they differ from the original data distribution. Our method enables goal-directed scene synthesis that respects physical feasibility and scales across scene types. We introduce a novel MCTS-based inference-time search strategy for diffusion models, enforce feasibility via projection and simulation, and release a dataset of over 44 million SE(3) scenes spanning five diverse environments.

Despite these advantages, CMI still encounters notable computational bottlenecks, especially during the image reconstruction stage. In this setting, both image recovery and object classification present significant processing demands. To address these challenges, our previous work introduced ClassiGAN, which is a generative deep learning model designed to simultaneously reconstruct images and classify targets using only back-scattered signals. In this study, we build upon that framework by incorporating attention gate modules into ClassiGAN. These modules are intended to refine feature extraction and improve the identification of relevant information. By dynamically focusing on important features and suppressing irrelevant ones, the attention mechanism enhances the overall model performance. The proposed architecture, named Att-ClassiGAN, significantly reduces the reconstruction time compared to traditional CMI approaches. Furthermore, it outperforms current advanced methods, delivering improved Normalized Mean Squared Error (NMSE), higher Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and better classification outcomes for the reconstructed targets."

However, collecting diverse demonstrations remains costly, motivating the need for scalable data augmentation. While prior work has explored visual augmentation in single-arm settings, extending these approaches to bimanual manipulation requires generating viewpoint-consistent observations across both arms and producing corresponding action labels that are both valid and feasible. In this work, we propose Diffusion for COordinated Dual-arm Data Augmentation (D-CODA), a method for offline data augmentation tailored to eye-in-hand bimanual imitation learning that trains a diffusion model to synthesize novel, viewpoint-consistent wrist-camera images for both arms while simultaneously generating joint-space action labels. It employs constrained optimization to ensure that augmented states involving gripper-to-object contacts adhere to constraints suitable for bimanual coordination. We evaluate D-CODA on 5 simulated and 3 real-world tasks.

Parameterized governing equations of the system are used in tandem with the measurements to regularize the regression problem. However, in real-world solution reconstruction problems, the parameterized governing equation may be inconsistent with the physical phenomena that give rise to the measurement data. We show that due to assuming consistency between the true and parameterized physics, PINNs-based approaches may fail to satisfy three basic criteria of interpretability, robustness, and data consistency. As we argue, these criteria ensure that (i) the quality of the reconstruction can be assessed, (ii) the reconstruction does not depend strongly on the choice of physics loss, and (iii) that in certain situations, the physics parameters can be uniquely recovered. In the context of elasticity and heat transfer, we demonstrate how standard formulations of the physics loss and techniques for constraining the solution to respect the measurement data lead to different ``constraint forces\" -- which we define as additional source terms arising from the constraints -- and that these constraint forces can significantly influence the reconstructed solution. To avoid the potentially substantial influence of the choice of physics loss and method of constraint enforcement on the reconstructed solution, we propose the ``explicit constraint force method'' (ECFM) to gain control of the source term introduced by the constraint. We then show that by satisfying the criteria of interpretability, robustness, and data consistency, this approach leads to more predictable and customizable reconstructions from noisy measurement data, even when the parameterization of the missing physics is inconsistent with the measured system."

Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated strong reasoning abilities, prompting exploration into their potential for this challenge. In this work, we introduce GroverGPT-2, an LLM-based method for simulating Grover's algorithm using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and quantum-native tokenization. Building on its predecessor, GroverGPT-2 performs simulation directly from quantum circuit representations while producing logically structured and interpretable outputs. Our results show that GroverGPT-2 can learn and internalize quantum circuit logic through efficient processing of quantum-native tokens, providing direct evidence that classical models like LLMs can capture the structure of quantum algorithms. Furthermore, GroverGPT-2 outputs interleave circuit data with natural language, embedding explicit reasoning into the simulation. This dual capability positions GroverGPT-2 as a prototype for advancing machine understanding of quantum algorithms and modeling quantum circuit logic. We also identify an empirical scaling law for GroverGPT-2 with increasing qubit numbers, suggesting a path toward scalable classical simulation. These findings open new directions for exploring the limits of classical simulatability, enhancing quantum education and research, and laying groundwork for future foundation models in quantum computing."

However, the precise selection is difficult and such a switching causes abrupt changes in actions, damaging the dynamic stability. This paper therefore proposes a novel method, so-called CubeDAgger, which improves robustness while reducing dynamic stability violations by making three improvements to a baseline method, EnsembleDAgger. The first improvement adds a regularization to explicitly activate the threshold for deciding the supervision timing. The second transforms the expert-agent switching system to an optimal consensus system of multiple action candidates. Third, autoregressive colored noise to the actions is introduced to make the stochastic exploration consistent over time. These improvements are verified by simulations, showing that the learned policies are sufficiently robust while maintaining dynamic stability during interaction."

Nevertheless, the theoretical understanding of the generalization behavior of CRL is limited. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, the current literature only analyzes generalization bounds under the assumption that the data tuples used for contrastive learning are independently and identically distributed. However, in practice, we are often limited to a fixed pool of reusable labeled data points, making it inevitable to recycle data across tuples to create sufficiently large datasets. Therefore, the tuple-wise independence condition imposed by previous works is invalidated. In this paper, we provide a generalization analysis for the CRL framework under non-$i.i.d.$ settings that adheres to practice more realistically. Drawing inspiration from the literature on U-statistics, we derive generalization bounds which indicate the required number of samples in each class scales as the logarithm of the covering number of the class of learnable feature representations associated to each class. Next, we apply our main results to derive excess risk bounds for common function classes such as linear maps and neural networks."

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been adopted for prompt-based recommendation due to their ability to generate personalized outputs without task-specific training. However, LLM-based methods face limitations such as limited context window size, inefficient pointwise and pairwise prompting, and difficulty handling listwise ranking due to token constraints. LLMs can also be sensitive to position bias, as they may overemphasize earlier items in the prompt regardless of their true relevance. To address and investigate these issues, we propose a hybrid framework that combines a traditional recommendation model with an LLM for reranking top-k items using structured prompts. We evaluate the effects of user history reordering and instructional prompts for mitigating position bias. Experiments on MovieLens-100K show that randomizing user history improves ranking quality, but LLM-based reranking does not outperform the base model. Explicit instructions to reduce position bias are also ineffective. Our evaluations reveal limitations in LLMs' ability to model ranking context and mitigate bias.

The existing work that provides finite sample guarantees for linear system identification typically uses data from a single long system trajectory under i.i.d. random inputs, and assumes that the underlying dynamics is truly linear. In contrast, we consider the problem of identifying a linearized model when the true underlying dynamics is nonlinear, given that there is a certain constraint on the region where one can initialize the experiments. We provide a multiple trajectories-based deterministic data acquisition algorithm followed by a regularized least squares algorithm, and provide a finite sample error bound on the learned linearized dynamics. Our error bound shows that one can consistently learn the linearized dynamics, and demonstrates a trade-off between the error due to nonlinearity and the error due to noise. We validate our results through numerical experiments, where we also show the potential insufficiency of linear system identification using a single trajectory with i.i.d. random inputs, when nonlinearity does exist."

The proposed method leverages 3DGS to address the challenges of motion-resolved 3D isotropic pulmonary MRI reconstruction by enabling data smoothing between voxels for continuous spatial representation. Pulmonary MRI data acquisition is performed using a golden-angle radial sampling trajectory, with respiratory motion signals extracted from the center of k-space in each radial spoke. Based on the estimated motion signal, the k-space data is sorted into multiple respiratory phases. A 3DGS framework is then applied to reconstruct a reference image volume from the first motion state. Subsequently, a patient-specific convolutional neural network is trained to estimate the deformation vector fields (DVFs), which are used to generate the remaining motion states through spatial transformation of the reference volume. The proposed reconstruction pipeline is evaluated on six datasets from six subjects and bench-marked against three state-of-the-art reconstruction methods. The experimental findings demonstrate that the proposed reconstruction framework effectively reconstructs high-resolution, motion-resolved pulmonary MR images. Compared with existing approaches, it achieves superior image quality, reflected by higher signal-to-noise ratio and contrast-to-noise ratio. The proposed unsupervised 3DGS-based reconstruction method enables accurate motion-resolved pulmonary MRI with isotropic spatial resolution. Its superior performance in image quality metrics over state-of-the-art methods highlights its potential as a robust solution for clinical pulmonary MR imaging."

Nevertheless, our empirical and theoretical findings unequivocally demonstrate a pronounced optimization gradient bias in favor of acquiring representations from multimodal features over item ID embeddings. As a consequence, item ID embeddings frequently exhibit suboptimal characteristics despite the convergence of multimodal feature parameters. Given the rich informational content inherent in multimodal features, in this paper, we propose a novel model (i.e., LIRDRec) that learns item representations directly from these features to augment recommendation performance. Recognizing that features derived from each modality may capture disparate yet correlated aspects of items, we propose a multimodal transformation mechanism, integrated with modality-specific encoders, to effectively fuse features from all modalities. Moreover, to differentiate the influence of diverse modality types, we devise a progressive weight copying fusion module within LIRDRec. This module incrementally learns the weight assigned to each modality in synthesizing the final user or item representations. Finally, we utilize the powerful visual understanding of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to convert the item images into texts and extract semantics embeddings upon the texts via LLMs. Empirical evaluations conducted on five real-world datasets validate the superiority of our approach relative to competing baselines. It is worth noting the proposed model, equipped with embeddings extracted from MLLMs and LLMs, can further improve the recommendation accuracy of NDCG@20 by an average of 4.21% compared to the original embeddings."

Existing multi-objective optimization methods often rely on manually tuned aggregation functions to formulate a joint optimization target. The performance of such hand-tuned methods is heavily dependent on careful weight selection, a time-consuming and laborious process. These limitations also arise in the setting of reinforcement-learning-based motion tracking for physically simulated characters, where intricately crafted reward functions are typically used to achieve high-fidelity results.

The results show the ability to command the drone at $\\sim8$ frames-per-second and a model performance reaching a COCO mean-average-precision of $60.8$.

However, this exchangeability is compromised when some entries of the test feature are contaminated, such as in the case of cellwise outliers. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel framework called detect-then-impute conformal prediction. This framework first employs an outlier detection procedure on the test feature and then utilizes an imputation method to fill in those cells identified as outliers. To quantify the uncertainty in the processed test feature, we adaptively apply the detection and imputation procedures to the calibration set, thereby constructing exchangeable features for the conformal prediction interval of the test label. We develop two practical algorithms, PDI-CP and JDI-CP, and provide a distribution-free coverage analysis under some commonly used detection and imputation procedures.

Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our proposed algorithms exhibit robust coverage properties and comparable efficiency to the oracle baseline."

Nevertheless, most existing studies primarily focus on the gesture generation of speakers, overlooking the vital role of listeners in the interaction process and failing to fully explore the dynamic interaction between them. This paper innovatively proposes an Inter-Diffusion Generation Model of Speakers and Listeners for Effective Communication. For the first time, we integrate the full-body gestures of listeners into the generation framework. By devising a novel inter-diffusion mechanism, this model can accurately capture the complex interaction patterns between speakers and listeners during communication. In the model construction process, based on the advanced diffusion model architecture, we innovatively introduce interaction conditions and the GAN model to increase the denoising step size. As a result, when generating gesture sequences, the model can not only dynamically generate based on the speaker's speech information but also respond in realtime to the listener's feedback, enabling synergistic interaction between the two. Abundant experimental results demonstrate that compared with the current state-of-the-art gesture generation methods, the model we proposed has achieved remarkable improvements in the naturalness, coherence, and speech-gesture synchronization of the generated gestures. In the subjective evaluation experiments, users highly praised the generated interaction scenarios, believing that they are closer to real life human communication situations. Objective index evaluations also show that our model outperforms the baseline methods in multiple key indicators, providing more powerful support for effective communication."

A promising approach to address this bottleneck is to harness the abundance of unlabeled observations-e.g., from video demonstrations-to learn latent action labels in an unsupervised way. However, we find that existing methods struggle when applied to complex robot tasks requiring fine-grained motions. We design continuous latent action models (CLAM) which incorporate two key ingredients we find necessary for learning to solve complex continuous control tasks from unlabeled observation data: (a) using continuous latent action labels instead of discrete representations, and (b) jointly training an action decoder to ensure that the latent action space can be easily grounded to real actions with relatively few labeled examples. Importantly, the labeled examples can be collected from non-optimal play data, enabling CLAM to learn performant policies without access to any action-labeled expert data. We demonstrate on continuous control benchmarks in DMControl (locomotion) and MetaWorld (manipulation), as well as on a real WidowX robot arm that CLAM significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods, remarkably with a 2-3x improvement in task success rate compared to the best baseline.

Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for pathology image segmentation; however, model performance is significantly influenced by variations in staining characteristics, necessitating effective stain normalization and enhancement techniques. In this study, we address these challenges by introducing an open-source dataset (ADNP-15) of neuritic plaques (i.e., amyloid deposits combined with a crown of dystrophic tau-positive neurites) in human brain whole slide images. We establish a comprehensive benchmark by evaluating five widely adopted deep learning models across four stain normalization techniques, providing deeper insights into their influence on neuritic plaque segmentation.

To this end, a neural network model RepSNet was designed based on a nucleus boundary regression and a structural re-parameterization scheme for segmenting and classifying the nuclei in H\\&amp;E-stained histopathological images. First, RepSNet estimates the boundary position information (BPI) of the parent nucleus for each pixel. The BPI estimation incorporates the local information of the pixel and the contextual information of the parent nucleus. Then, the nucleus boundary is estimated by aggregating the BPIs from a series of pixels using a proposed boundary voting mechanism (BVM), and the instance segmentation results are computed from the estimated nucleus boundary using a connected component analysis procedure. The BVM intrinsically achieves a kind of synergistic belief enhancement among the BPIs from various pixels. Therefore, different from the methods available in literature that obtain nucleus boundaries based on a direct pixel recognition scheme, RepSNet computes its boundary decisions based on some guidances from macroscopic information using an integration mechanism. In addition, RepSNet employs a re-parametrizable encoder-decoder structure. This model can not only aggregate features from some receptive fields with various scales which helps segmentation accuracy improvement, but also reduce the parameter amount and computational burdens in the model inference phase through the structural re-parameterization technique. Extensive experiments demonstrated the superiorities of RepSNet compared to several typical benchmark models."

Generating standard-dose PET (SPET) from low-dose PET (LPET) has become a potential solution. However, previous studies have primarily focused on single low-dose PET denoising, neglecting two critical factors: discrepancies in dose response caused by inter-patient variability, and complementary anatomical constraints derived from CT images. In this work, we propose a novel CT-Guided Multi-dose Adaptive Attention Denoising Diffusion Model (MDAA-Diff) for multi-dose PET denoising. Our approach integrates anatomical guidance and dose-level adaptation to achieve superior denoising performance under low-dose conditions. Specifically, this approach incorporates a CT-Guided High-frequency Wavelet Attention (HWA) module, which uses wavelet transforms to separate high-frequency anatomical boundary features from CT images. These extracted features are then incorporated into PET imaging through an adaptive weighted fusion mechanism to enhance edge details. Additionally, we propose the Dose-Adaptive Attention (DAA) module, a dose-conditioned enhancement mechanism that dynamically integrates dose levels into channel-spatial attention weight calculation. Extensive experiments on 18F-FDG and 68Ga-FAPI datasets demonstrate that MDAA-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in preserving diagnostic quality under reduced-dose conditions. Our code is publicly available."

Cypher, a powerful query language for graph databases, enables efficient modeling and querying. Recent advancements in large language models allow translation of natural language questions into Cypher queries - Text2Cypher. A common approach is incorporating database schema into prompts. However, complex schemas can introduce noise, increase hallucinations, and raise computational costs. Schema filtering addresses these challenges by including only relevant schema elements, improving query generation while reducing token costs. This work explores various schema filtering methods for Text2Cypher task and analyzes their impact on token length, performance, and cost. Results show that schema filtering effectively optimizes Text2Cypher, especially for smaller models. Consistent with prior research, we find that larger models benefit less from schema filtering due to their longer context capabilities. However, schema filtering remains valuable for both larger and smaller models in cost reduction."

We rigorously prove that classical discrete diffusion models, which calculate per-dimension transition probabilities to avoid exponential computational cost, exhibit worst-case linear scaling of Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence with data dimension. To address this, we propose a Quantum Discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (QD3PM), which enables joint probability learning through diffusion and denoising in exponentially large Hilbert spaces. By deriving posterior states through quantum Bayes' theorem, similar to the crucial role of posterior probabilities in classical diffusion models, and by learning the joint probability, we establish a solid theoretical foundation for quantum-enhanced diffusion models. For denoising, we design a quantum circuit using temporal information for parameter sharing and learnable classical-data-controlled rotations for encoding. Exploiting joint distribution learning, our approach enables single-step sampling from pure noise, eliminating iterative requirements of existing models. Simulations demonstrate the proposed model's superior accuracy in modeling complex distributions compared to factorization methods. Hence, this paper establishes a new theoretical paradigm in generative models by leveraging the quantum advantage in joint distribution learning."

The extrinsic local linear Fr\\'echet functional regression predictor is obtained in the time varying tangent space by projection into an orthornormal basis of the ambient Hilbert space. The conditions assumed ensure the existence and uniqueness of this predictor, and its computation via exponential and logarithmic maps. A weighted Fr\\'echet mean approach is adopted in the computation of an intrinsic local linear Fr\\'echet functional regression predictor. The asymptotic optimality of this intrinsic local approximation is also proved. The performance of the empirical version of both, extrinsic and intrinsic functional predictors, and of a Nadaraya-Watson type Fr\\'echet curve predictor is illustrated in the simulation study undertaken. The finite-sample size properties are also tested in a real-data application via cross-validation.

In this study, fuzzy sigmoid convolution (FSC) is introduced along with two additional modules: top-of-the-funnel and middle-of-the-funnel. The proposed methodology significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters without compromising classification accuracy. A novel convolutional operator is central to this approach, effectively dilating the receptive field while preserving input data integrity.

The inclusion of fuzzy logic into the architecture improves its adaptability and robustness. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance and efficiency of the proposed model.

Deep learning (DL) polyp detectors offer a promising solution. However, existing DL polyp detectors often mistake white light reflections from the endoscope for polyps, which can lead to false positives.To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel data augmentation approach that artificially adds more white light reflections to create harder training scenarios. Specifically, we first generate a bank of artificial lights using the training dataset. Then we find the regions of the training images that we should not add these artificial lights on. Finally, we propose a sliding window method to add the artificial light to the areas that fit of the training images, resulting in augmented images. By providing the model with more opportunities to make mistakes, we hypothesize that it will also have more chances to learn from those mistakes, ultimately improving its performance in polyp detection.

We propose ICNN-enhanced 2SP, a method that leverages Input Convex Neural Networks (ICNNs) to exploit linear programming (LP) representability in convex 2SP problems. By architecturally enforcing convexity and enabling exact inference through LP, our approach eliminates the need for integer variables inherent to the conventional MIP-based formulation while retaining an exact embedding of the ICNN surrogate within the 2SP framework. This results in a more computationally efficient alternative that maintains solution quality. Comprehensive experiments reveal that ICNNs incur only marginally longer training times while achieving validation accuracy on par with their MIP-based counterparts. Across benchmark problems, ICNN-enhanced 2SP often exhibits considerably faster solution times than the MIP-based formulations while preserving solution quality, with these advantages becoming significantly more pronounced as problem scale increases. For the most challenging instances, the method achieves speedups of up to 100$\\times$ and solution quality superior to MIP-based formulations."

The proposed test aims to assess text similarity by comparing the entropy of the documents. Entropy is estimated using neural network-based language models. The test statistic is derived from an estimation-and-inference framework, where the entropy is first approximated using an estimation set, followed by inference on the remaining data set.

In this paper, we consider learning a joint ideal distribution over both inputs and labels; and develop a link between rejection and thresholding different statistical divergences. We further find that when one considers a variant of the log-loss, the rejector obtained by considering the joint ideal distribution corresponds to the thresholding of the skewed Bhattacharyya divergence between class-probabilities. This is in contrast to the marginal case - that is equivalent to a typical characterization of optimal rejection, Chow's Rule - which corresponds to a thresholding of the Kullback-Leibler divergence.

Unlike humans, who often favor a dominant hand for fine dexterous skills, robots should ideally execute ambidextrous manipulation with equal proficiency. To this end, we introduce SYMDEX (SYMmetric DEXterity), a reinforcement learning framework for ambidextrous bi-manipulation that leverages the robot's inherent bilateral symmetry as an inductive bias. SYMDEX decomposes complex bimanual manipulation tasks into per-hand subtasks and trains dedicated policies for each. By exploiting bilateral symmetry via equivariant neural networks, experience from one arm is inherently leveraged by the opposite arm. We then distill the subtask policies into a global ambidextrous policy that is independent of the hand-task assignment. We evaluate SYMDEX on six challenging simulated manipulation tasks and demonstrate successful real-world deployment on two of them. Our approach strongly outperforms baselines on complex task in which the left and right hands perform different roles. We further demonstrate SYMDEX's scalability by extending it to a four-arm manipulation setup, where our symmetry-aware policies enable effective multi-arm collaboration and coordination.

Quickly achieving high-fidelity dynamic 3D reconstruction from a single viewpoint is a significant challenge in computer vision. In C-ToF radiance field reconstruction, the property of interest-depth-is not directly measured, causing an additional challenge. This problem has a large and underappreciated impact upon the optimization when using a fast primitive-based scene representation like 3D Gaussian splatting, which is commonly used with multi-view data to produce satisfactory results and is brittle in its optimization otherwise. We incorporate two heuristics into the optimization to improve the accuracy of scene geometry represented by Gaussians. Experimental results show that our approach produces accurate reconstructions under constrained C-ToF sensing conditions, including for fast motions like swinging baseball bats. https://visual.cs.brown.edu/gftorf"

While individual steps, such as sleep staging and spindle detection, have been studied separately, the feasibility of automating multi-step sleep analysis remains unclear. Here, we evaluate whether a fully automated analysis using state-of-the-art machine learning models for sleep staging (RobustSleepNet) and subsequent spindle detection (SUMOv2) can replicate findings from an expert-based study of bipolar disorder. The automated analysis qualitatively reproduced key findings from the expert-based study, including significant differences in fast spindle densities between bipolar patients and healthy controls, accomplishing in minutes what previously took months to complete manually. While the results of the automated analysis differed quantitatively from the expert-based study, possibly due to biases between expert raters or between raters and the models, the models individually performed at or above inter-rater agreement for both sleep staging and spindle detection. Our results demonstrate that fully automated approaches have the potential to facilitate large-scale sleep research. We are providing public access to the tools used in our automated analysis by sharing our code and introducing SomnoBot, a privacy-preserving sleep analysis platform."

Although most biometric age estimation studies have focused on facial features and adult subjects, pediatric-specific analysis, particularly of the iris and periocular regions, remains relatively unexplored. This study presents a comparative evaluation of iris and periocular images for estimating the ages of children aged between 4 and 16 years. We utilized a longitudinal dataset comprising more than 21,000 near-infrared (NIR) images, collected from 288 pediatric subjects over eight years using two different imaging sensors. A multi-task deep learning framework was employed to jointly perform age prediction and age-group classification, enabling a systematic exploration of how different convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, particularly those adapted for non-square ocular inputs, capture the complex variability inherent in pediatric eye images. The results show that periocular models consistently outperform iris-based models, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.33 years and an age-group classification accuracy of 83.82%. These results mark the first demonstration that reliable age estimation is feasible from children's ocular images, enabling privacy-preserving age checks in child-centric applications. This work establishes the first longitudinal benchmark for pediatric ocular age estimation, providing a foundation for designing robust, child-focused biometric systems. The developed models proved resilient across different imaging sensors, confirming their potential for real-world deployment. They also achieved inference speeds of less than 10 milliseconds per image on resource-constrained VR headsets, demonstrating their suitability for real-time applications."

Equivariant models of 3D point clouds are able to approximate structure-property relations in a way that is fully consistent with the structure of the rotation group, by combining intermediate representations that are themselves spherical tensors. The symmetry constraints however make this approach computationally demanding and cumbersome to implement, which motivates increasingly popular unconstrained architectures that learn approximate symmetries as part of the training process. In this work, we explore a third route to tackle this learning problem, where equivariant functions are expressed as the product of a scalar function of the point cloud coordinates and a small basis of tensors with the appropriate symmetry. We also propose approximations of the general expressions that, while lacking universal approximation properties, are fast, simple to implement, and accurate in practical settings."

The simulated system closely follows a previously reported model. We uncover an exceptional dynamical regime of agent dynamics that has been overlooked heretofore. It appears robustly optimal across varying physical parameters and inference tasks, thus providing valuable insights into computation and inference with physical systems more generally. The ability to form effective mechanisms for information processing are primarily determined by the system's own intrinsic relaxation abilities. These are identifiable when probing the system without a specific inference goal and manifest when testing minimalistic single-particle reservoirs. The regime that achieves optimal computation is situated just below the critical damping threshold, involving a microscopic dynamical relaxation with multiple stages. The optimal system is adaptable under chaotic external driving, due to a diversity in response mechanisms that emerge like rapid alternations between quasi-stationary and highly nonlinear dynamical states. Both coherent and incoherent dynamics contribute to their operation, partly at dissimilar scales of space and delay time. Correlations on agent dynamics can indicate the best-performing regimes and onsets of tight relationships between the responding system and the fluctuating driver. As this model of computation is interpretable in physical terms, it facilitates re-framing inquiries regarding learning and unconventional computing with a fresh rationale for many-body physics out of equilibrium."

Although most of them consider adversarial attacks, we identify that backdoor attack is indeed a more serious threat to 3D deep learning systems but remains unexplored. We present the backdoor attacks in 3D point cloud with a unified framework that exploits the unique properties of 3D data and networks. In particular, we design two attack approaches on point cloud: the poison-label backdoor attack (PointPBA) and the clean-label backdoor attack (PointCBA). The first one is straightforward and effective in practice, while the latter is more sophisticated assuming there are certain data inspections. The attack algorithms are mainly motivated and developed by 1) the recent discovery of 3D adversarial samples suggesting the vulnerability of deep models under spatial transformation; 2) the proposed feature disentanglement technique that manipulates the feature of the data through optimization methods and its potential to embed a new task. Extensive experiments show the efficacy of the PointPBA with over 95% success rate across various 3D datasets and models, and the more stealthy PointCBA with around 50% success rate. Our proposed backdoor attack in 3D point cloud is expected to perform as a baseline for improving the robustness of 3D deep models."

To generate complete trajectories such methods employ a data association process to establish assignments between detections and existing targets during each timestep. Recent data association approaches try to solve either a multi-dimensional linear assignment task or a network flow minimization problem or tackle it via multiple hypotheses tracking. However, during inference an optimization step that computes optimal assignments is required for every sequence frame inducing additional complexity to any given solution. To this end, in the context of this work we introduce Transformer-based Assignment Decision Network (TADN) that tackles data association without the need of any explicit optimization during inference. In particular, TADN can directly infer assignment pairs between detections and active targets in a single forward pass of the network. We have integrated TADN in a rather simple MOT framework, designed a novel training strategy for efficient end-to-end training and demonstrated the high potential of our approach for online visual tracking-by-detection MOT on several popular benchmarks, i.e. MOT17, MOT20 and UA-DETRAC. Our proposed approach demonstrates strong performance in most evaluation metrics despite its simple nature as a tracker lacking significant auxiliary components such as occlusion handling or re-identification.

In this Position, drawing from human psychometrics, we discuss a paradigm shift from static evaluation methods to adaptive testing. This involves estimating the characteristics or value of each test item in the benchmark, and tailoring each model's evaluation instead of relying on a fixed test set. This paradigm provides robust ability estimation, uncovering the latent traits underlying a model's observed scores.

Both traditional prior-based approaches and deep learning-based methods have been used to address this problem. However, the inflexible assumption of the former often impairs their effectiveness in handling diverse underwater scenes, while the generalization of the latter to unseen images is usually weakened by insufficient data. In this study, we leverage both the physics-based Image Formation Model (IFM) and deep learning techniques for Underwater Image Enhancement (UIE). To this end, we propose a novel Physics-Aware Triple-Stream Underwater Image Enhancement Network, i.e., PATS-UIENet, which comprises a Direct Signal Transmission Estimation Steam (D-Stream), a Backscatter Signal Transmission Estimation Steam (B-Stream) and an Ambient Light Estimation Stream (A-Stream). This network fulfills the UIE task by explicitly estimating the degradation parameters of a revised IFM. We also adopt an IFM-inspired semi-supervised learning framework, which exploits both the labeled and unlabeled images, to address the issue of insufficient data. To our knowledge, such a physics-aware deep network and the IFM-inspired semi-supervised learning framework have not been used for the UIE task before. Our method performs better than, or at least comparably to, sixteen baselines across six testing sets in the degradation estimation and UIE tasks. These promising results should be due to the fact that the proposed method can not only model the degradation but also learn the characteristics of diverse underwater scenes."

Substantial advances were achieved for wide networks, within two disparate theoretical frameworks: the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), which assumes linearized gradient descent dynamics, and the Bayesian Neural Network Gaussian Process (NNGP). We unify these two theories using gradient descent learning with an additional noise in an ensemble of wide deep networks. We construct an analytical theory for the network input-output function and introduce a new time-dependent Neural Dynamical Kernel (NDK) from which both NTK and NNGP kernels are derived. We identify two learning phases: a gradient-driven learning phase, dominated by loss minimization, in which the time scale is governed by the initialization variance. It is followed by a slow diffusive learning stage, where the parameters sample the solution space, with a time constant decided by the noise and the Bayesian prior variance. The two variance parameters strongly affect the performance in the two regimes, especially in sigmoidal neurons. In contrast to the exponential convergence of the mean predictor in the initial phase, the convergence to the equilibrium is more complex and may behave nonmonotonically. By characterizing the diffusive phase, our work sheds light on representational drift in the brain, explaining how neural activity changes continuously without degrading performance, either by ongoing gradient signals that synchronize the drifts of different synapses or by architectural biases that generate task-relevant information that is robust against the drift process. This work closes the gap between the NTK and NNGP theories, providing a comprehensive framework for the learning process of deep wide neural networks and for analyzing dynamics in biological circuits."

But in many cases the universe is too big for people to plausibly consider all options. In the choice literature, this issue has been addressed by supposing that individuals first sample a small consideration set and then choose among the considered items. However, inferring unobserved consideration sets (or item consideration probabilities) in this \"consider then choose\" setting poses significant challenges, because even simple models of consideration with strong independence assumptions are not identifiable, even if item utilities are known. We apply the consider-then-choose framework to top-$k$ rankings, where we assume rankings are constructed according to a Plackett-Luce model after sampling a consideration set. While item consideration probabilities remain non-identified in this setting, we prove that we can infer bounds on the relative values of consideration probabilities. Additionally, given a condition on the expected consideration set size and known item utilities, we derive absolute upper and lower bounds on item consideration probabilities. We also provide algorithms to tighten those bounds on consideration probabilities by propagating inferred constraints. Thus, we show that we can learn useful information about consideration probabilities despite not being able to identify them precisely. We demonstrate our methods on a ranking dataset from a psychology experiment with two different ranking tasks (one with fixed consideration sets and one with unknown consideration sets). This combination of data allows us to estimate utilities and then learn about unknown consideration probabilities using our bounds."

In this paper, we propose a straightforward, novel, and training-free hardness score named Distorting-based Learning Complexity (DLC), to identify informative images and instructions from the downstream dataset efficiently. Our method is motivated by the observation that easy samples learned faster can also be learned with fewer parameters. Specifically, we define the Learning Complexity to quantify sample hardness and utilize a lightweight weights masking process for fast estimation, instead of the costly SGD optimization. Based on DLC, we further design a flexible under-sampling with randomness (dubbed FlexRand), replacing the top-K strategy, to alleviate the severe subset distribution shift. Extensive experiments with downstream image and instructions dataset pruning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach. In the images pruning benchmark, DLC significantly reduces the pruning time by 35x while establishing state-of-the-art performance with FlexRand."

        "summary": "arXiv:2403.01695v3 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Conventional deep learning (DL) model compression and scaling methods focus on altering the model's components, impacting the results across all samples uniformly. However, since samples vary in difficulty, a dynamic model that adapts computation based on sample complexity offers a novel perspective for compression and scaling. Despite this potential, existing dynamic models are typically monolithic and model-specific, limiting their generalizability as broad compression and scaling methods. Additionally, most deployed DL systems are fixed, unable to adjust their scale once deployed and, therefore, cannot adapt to the varying real-time demands. This paper introduces DyCE, a dynamically configurable system that can adjust the performance-complexity trade-off of a DL model at runtime without requiring re-initialization or redeployment on inference hardware. DyCE achieves this by adding small exit networks to intermediate layers of the original model, allowing computation to terminate early if acceptable results are obtained. DyCE also decouples the design of an efficient dynamic model, facilitating easy adaptation to new base models and potential general use in compression and scaling. We also propose methods for generating optimized configurations and determining the types and positions of exit networks to achieve desired performance and complexity trade-offs. By enabling simple configuration switching, DyCE provides fine-grained performance tuning in real-time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DyCE through image classification tasks using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). DyCE significantly reduces computational complexity by 23.5% for ResNet152 and 25.9% for ConvNextv2-tiny on ImageNet, with accuracy reductions of less than 0.5%."

To that aim, we generated a database with 996 entries, which includes up to 7 variables regarding both the manufacturing process and environmental conditions for more than 180 days. Then, we relied on a software framework that brings together a conglomeration of automated ML protocols that execute sequentially against our database by simply command-line interface. This easily permits hyper-optimizing and randomizing seeds of the ML models through exhaustive benchmarking so that optimal models are obtained. The accuracy achieved reaches values of the coefficient determination (R2) widely exceeding 0.90, whereas the root mean squared error (RMSE), sum of squared error (SSE), and mean absolute error (MAE)>1% of the target value, the PCE. Additionally, we contribute with validated models able to screen the behavior of OSCs never seen in the database. In that case, R2~0.96-0.97 and RMSE~1%, thus confirming the reliability of the proposal to predict. For comparative purposes, classical Bayesian regression fitting based on non-linear mean squares (LMS) are also presented, which only perform sufficiently for univariate cases of single OSCs. Hence they fail to outperform the breadth of the capabilities shown by the ML models. Finally, thanks to the standardized results offered by the ML framework, we study the dependencies between the variables of the dataset and their implications for the optimal performance and stability of the OSCs. Reproducibility is ensured by a standardized report altogether with the dataset, which are publicly available at Github."

This work aims to capture the effect and benefits of depth for supervised learning via information-theoretic generalization bounds. We first derive two hierarchical bounds on the generalization error in terms of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence or the 1-Wasserstein distance between the train and test distributions of the network internal representations. The KL divergence bound shrinks as the layer index increases, while the Wasserstein bound implies the existence of a layer that serves as a generalization funnel, which attains a minimal 1-Wasserstein distance. Analytic expressions for both bounds are derived under the setting of binary Gaussian classification with linear DNNs. To quantify the contraction of the relevant information measures when moving deeper into the network, we analyze the strong data processing inequality (SDPI) coefficient between consecutive layers of three regularized DNN models: $\\mathsf{Dropout}$, $\\mathsf{DropConnect}$, and Gaussian noise injection. This enables refining our generalization bounds to capture the contraction as a function of the network architecture parameters. Specializing our results to DNNs with a finite parameter space and the Gibbs algorithm reveals that deeper yet narrower network architectures generalize better in those examples, although how broadly this statement applies remains a question."

Despite the remarkable performance exhibited by previous MSA approaches, the presence of inherent multimodal heterogeneities poses a challenge, with the contribution of different modalities varying considerably. Past research predominantly focused on improving representation learning techniques and feature fusion strategies. However, many of these efforts overlooked the variation in semantic richness among different modalities, treating each modality uniformly. This approach may lead to underestimating the significance of strong modalities while overemphasizing the importance of weak ones. Motivated by these insights, we introduce a Text-oriented Cross-Attention Network (TCAN), emphasizing the predominant role of the text modality in MSA. Specifically, for each multimodal sample, by taking unaligned sequences of the three modalities as inputs, we initially allocate the extracted unimodal features into a visual-text and an acoustic-text pair. Subsequently, we implement self-attention on the text modality and apply text-queried cross-attention to the visual and acoustic modalities. To mitigate the influence of noise signals and redundant features, we incorporate a gated control mechanism into the framework. Additionally, we introduce unimodal joint learning to gain a deeper understanding of homogeneous emotional tendencies across diverse modalities through backpropagation. Experimental results demonstrate that TCAN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MSA methods on two datasets (CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI)."

To address this, this paper introduces a probabilistic method to learn the degree of equivariance in SCNNs. We parameterise the degree of equivariance as a likelihood distribution over the transformation group using Fourier coefficients, offering the option to model layer-wise and shared equivariance. These likelihood distributions are regularised to ensure an interpretable degree of equivariance across the network. Advantages include the applicability to many types of equivariant networks through the flexible framework of SCNNs and the ability to learn equivariance with respect to any subgroup of any compact group without requiring additional layers. Our experiments reveal competitive performance on datasets with mixed symmetries, with learnt likelihood distributions that are representative of the underlying degree of equivariance."

Our approach uses a ControlNet to refine rendered back-view images from coarse predicted human Gaussians, then uses the refined image along with the input image to reconstruct refined human Gaussians. To mitigate the potential generation of unrealistic human poses and shapes, we incorporate human priors from the SMPL-X model as a dual branch, propagating image features from the SMPL-X volume to the image Gaussians using sparse convolution and attention mechanisms. Given that the initial SMPL-X estimation might be inaccurate, we gradually refine it with our HGM model. We validate our approach on several publicly available datasets. Our method surpasses previous methods in both novel view synthesis and surface reconstruction. Our approach also exhibits strong generalization for cross-dataset evaluation and in-the-wild images."

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such theoretical result. Retraining finds application in improving training with local label differential privacy (DP) which involves training with noisy labels. We empirically show that retraining selectively on the samples for which the predicted label matches the given label significantly improves label DP training at no extra privacy cost; we call this consensus-based retraining.

However, our experimental validation reveals two key obstacles limiting the accuracy improvement of crowd counting models: 1) the domain gap between the adverse weather and the normal weather images; 2) the weather class imbalance in the training set. To address the problems, we propose a two-stage crowd counting method named Multi-queue Contrastive Learning (MQCL). Specifically, in the first stage, our target is to equip the backbone network with weather-awareness capabilities. In this process, a contrastive learning method named multi-queue MoCo designed by us is employed to enable representation learning under weather class imbalance. After the first stage is completed, the backbone model is \"mature\" enough to extract weather-related representations. On this basis, we proceed to the second stage, in which we propose to refine the representations under the guidance of contrastive learning, enabling the conversion of the weather-aware representations to the normal weather domain. Through such representation and conversion, the model achieves robust counting performance under both normal and adverse weather conditions. Extensive experimental results show that, compared to the baseline, MQCL reduces the counting error under adverse weather conditions by 22%, while introducing only about 13% increase in computational burden, which achieves state-of-the-art performance."

In this paper, we solve the nonparametric contextual bandit problem with unbounded contexts. We propose two nearest neighbor methods combined with UCB exploration. The first method uses a fixed $k$. Our analysis shows that this method achieves minimax optimal regret under a weak margin condition and relatively light-tailed context distributions. The second method uses adaptive $k$. By a proper data-driven selection of $k$, this method achieves an expected regret of $\\tilde{O}\\left(T^{1-\\frac{(\\alpha+1)\\beta}{\\alpha+(d+2)\\beta}}+T^{1-\\beta}\\right)$, in which $\\beta$ is a parameter describing the tail strength. This bound matches the minimax lower bound up to logarithm factors, indicating that the second method is approximately optimal."

However, the manual processing of these datasets is time-consuming, hindering analytical processes. To address this, deep neural networks have been adopted to automate image labelling, but the impact of classification error on ecological metrics remains unclear. Here, we analyse data from camera trap collections in an African savannah (82,300 images, 47 species) and an Asian sub-tropical dry forest (40,308 images, 29 species) to compare ecological metrics derived from expert-generated species identifications with those generated by deep learning classification models. We specifically assess the impact of deep learning model architecture, the proportion of label noise in the training data, and the size of the training dataset on three ecological metrics: species richness, occupancy, and activity patterns. Overall, ecological metrics derived from deep neural networks closely match those calculated from expert labels and remain robust to manipulations in the training pipeline. We found that the choice of deep learning model architecture does not impact ecological metrics, and ecological metrics related to the overall community (species richness, community occupancy) were resilient to up to 10% noise in the training dataset and a 50% reduction in the training dataset size. However, we caution that less common species are disproportionately affected by a reduction in deep neural network accuracy, and this has consequences for species-specific metrics (occupancy, diel activity patterns). To ensure the reliability of their findings, practitioners should prioritize creating large, clean training sets with balanced representation across species over exploring numerous deep learning model architectures."

Moreover, these methods often utilize highly customized backbones, which hinder their adaptability and integration into more advanced restoration networks. To address these limitations, we propose Perceive-IR, a novel backbone-agnostic All-in-One image restoration framework designed for fine-grained quality control across various degradation types and severity levels. Its modular structure allows core components to function independently of specific backbones, enabling seamless integration into advanced restoration models without significant modifications. Specifically, Perceive-IR operates in two key stages: 1) multi-level quality-driven prompt learning stage, where a fine-grained quality perceiver is meticulously trained to discern three tier quality levels by optimizing the alignment between prompts and images within the CLIP perception space. This stage ensures a nuanced understanding of image quality, laying the groundwork for subsequent restoration; 2) restoration stage, where the quality perceiver is seamlessly integrated with a difficulty-adaptive perceptual loss, forming a quality-aware learning strategy. This strategy not only dynamically differentiates sample learning difficulty but also achieves fine-grained quality control by driving the restored image toward the ground truth while pulling it away from both low- and medium-quality samples."

However, complex audio-visual scenes often involve asynchronization between modalities, making accurate localization challenging. Existing DAVE solutions extract audio and visual features through unimodal encoders, and fuse them via dense cross-modal interaction. However, independent unimodal encoding struggles to emphasize shared semantics between modalities without cross-modal guidance, while dense cross-modal attention may over-attend to semantically unrelated audio-visual features. To address these problems, we present LoCo, a Locality-aware cross-modal Correspondence learning framework for DAVE. LoCo leverages the local temporal continuity of audio-visual events as important guidance to filter irrelevant cross-modal signals and enhance cross-modal alignment throughout both unimodal and cross-modal encoding stages. i) Specifically, LoCo applies Local Correspondence Feature (LCF) Modulation to enforce unimodal encoders to focus on modality-shared semantics by modulating agreement between audio and visual features based on local cross-modal coherence. ii) To better aggregate cross-modal relevant features, we further customize Local Adaptive Cross-modal (LAC) Interaction, which dynamically adjusts attention regions in a data-driven manner. This adaptive mechanism focuses attention on local event boundaries and accommodates varying event durations. By incorporating LCF and LAC, LoCo provides solid performance gains and outperforms existing DAVE methods."

The Only-Train-Once (OTO) series has been recently proposed to resolve the many pain points by streamlining the workflow by automatically conducting (i) search space generation, (ii) structured sparse optimization, and (iii) sub-network construction. However, the built-in sparse optimizers in the OTO series, i.e., the Half-Space Projected Gradient (HSPG) family, have limitations that require hyper-parameter tuning and the implicit controls of the sparsity exploration, consequently requires intervening by human expertise. To address such limitations, we propose a Hybrid Efficient Structured Sparse Optimizer (HESSO). HESSO could automatically and efficiently train a DNN to produce a high-performing subnetwork. Meanwhile, it is almost tuning-free and enjoys user-friendly integration for generic training applications. To address another common issue of irreversible performance collapse observed in pruning DNNs, we further propose a Corrective Redundant Identification Cycle (CRIC) for reliably identifying indispensable structures. We numerically demonstrate the efficacy of HESSO and its enhanced version HESSO-CRIC on a variety of applications ranging from computer vision to natural language processing, including large language model. The numerical results showcase that HESSO can achieve competitive even superior performance to varying state-of-the-arts and support most DNN architectures.

Image generative models are able to provide data creation at scale, but utilizing these models for texture synthesis has been unexplored and poses additional challenges both in creating accurate texture images and validating those images. In this work, we introduce an extensible methodology and corresponding new dataset for generating high-quality, diverse texture images capable of supporting a broad set of texture-based tasks. Our pipeline consists of: (1) developing prompts from a range of descriptors to serve as input to text-to-image models, (2) adopting and adapting Stable Diffusion pipelines to generate and filter the corresponding images, and (3) further filtering down to the highest quality images. Through this, we create the Prompted Textures Dataset (PTD), a dataset of 362,880 texture images that span 56 textures. During the process of generating images, we find that NSFW safety filters in image generation pipelines are highly sensitive to texture (and flag up to 60\\% of our texture images), uncovering a potential bias in these models and presenting unique challenges when working with texture data.

To analyze this, we conducted a quantitative meta-analysis covering over 100 papers using CoT and ran our own evaluations of 20 datasets across 14 models. Our results show that CoT gives strong performance benefits primarily on tasks involving math or logic, with much smaller gains on other types of tasks. On MMLU, directly generating the answer without CoT leads to almost identical accuracy as CoT unless the question or model's response contains an equals sign, indicating symbolic operations and reasoning. Following this finding, we analyze the behavior of CoT on these problems by separating planning and execution and comparing against tool-augmented LLMs. Much of CoT's gain comes from improving symbolic execution, but it underperforms relative to using a symbolic solver. Our results indicate that CoT can be applied selectively, maintaining performance while saving inference costs. Furthermore, they suggest a need to move beyond prompt-based CoT to new paradigms that better leverage intermediate computation across the whole range of LLM applications."

State-of-the-art ML-based HLS methods, such as HARP, first train a deep learning model, typically based on graph neural networks (GNNs) applied to graph-based representations of the source code and pragmas. They then perform design space exploration (DSE) to explore the pragma design space, rank candidate designs using the model, and return the top designs. However, traditional DSE methods face challenges due to the highly nonlinear relationship between pragma settings and performance metrics, along with complex interactions between pragmas that affect performance in non-obvious ways.\n  To address these challenges, we propose compareXplore, a novel approach that learns to compare hardware designs for effective HLS optimization. CompareXplore introduces a hybrid loss function that combines pairwise preference learning with pointwise performance prediction, enabling the model to capture both relative preferences and absolute performance. Moreover, we introduce a novel node difference attention module that focuses on the most informative differences between designs, enabling the model to identify critical pragmas impacting performance.

However, previous dominating MORL methods typically generate a fixed policy set or preference-conditioned policy through multiple training iterations exclusively for sampled preference vectors, and cannot ensure the efficient discovery of the Pareto front. Furthermore, integrating preferences into the input of policy or value functions presents scalability challenges, in particular as the dimension of the state and preference space grow, which can complicate the learning process and hinder the algorithm's performance on more complex tasks. To address these issues, we propose a two-stage Pareto front discovery algorithm called Constrained MORL (C-MORL), which serves as a seamless bridge between constrained policy optimization and MORL. Concretely, a set of policies is trained in parallel in the initialization stage, with each optimized towards its individual preference over the multiple objectives. Then, to fill the remaining vacancies in the Pareto front, the constrained optimization steps are employed to maximize one objective while constraining the other objectives to exceed a predefined threshold. Empirically, compared to recent advancements in MORL methods, our algorithm achieves more consistent and superior performances in terms of hypervolume, expected utility, and sparsity on both discrete and continuous control tasks, especially with numerous objectives (up to nine objectives in our experiments)."

To address this issue, we propose MemVR, a novel decoding paradigm inspired by common cognition: when the memory of an image seen the moment before is forgotten, people will look at it again for factual answers. Following this principle, we treat visual tokens as supplementary evidence, re-injecting them into the MLLM through Feed Forward Network (FFN) as \"key-value memory\" at the middle trigger layer. This \"look-twice\" mechanism occurs when the model exhibits high uncertainty during inference, effectively enhancing factual alignment. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that MemVR significantly mitigates hallucination across various MLLMs and excels in general benchmarks without incurring additional time overhead.

In this paper, we present Motion DUSt3R (MonST3R), a novel geometry-first approach that directly estimates per-timestep geometry from dynamic scenes. Our key insight is that by simply estimating a pointmap for each timestep, we can effectively adapt DUST3R's representation, previously only used for static scenes, to dynamic scenes. However, this approach presents a significant challenge: the scarcity of suitable training data, namely dynamic, posed videos with depth labels. Despite this, we show that by posing the problem as a fine-tuning task, identifying several suitable datasets, and strategically training the model on this limited data, we can surprisingly enable the model to handle dynamics, even without an explicit motion representation. Based on this, we introduce new optimizations for several downstream video-specific tasks and demonstrate strong performance on video depth and camera pose estimation, outperforming prior work in terms of robustness and efficiency.

Previous studies have mainly concentrated on Large Language Models (LLMs), while the self-correction abilities of VLMs, particularly concerning both visual and linguistic information, remain largely unexamined. This study investigates the self-correction capabilities of VLMs during both inference and fine-tuning stages. We introduce a Self-Correction Learning (SCL) approach that enables VLMs to learn from their self-generated self-correction data through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) without relying on external feedback, facilitating self-improvement. Specifically, we collect preferred and disfavored samples based on the correctness of initial and refined responses, which are obtained by two-turn self-correction with VLMs during the inference stage. Experimental results demonstrate that although VLMs struggle to self-correct effectively during iterative inference without additional fine-tuning and external feedback, they can enhance their performance and avoid previous mistakes through preference fine-tuning when their self-generated self-correction data are categorized into preferred and disfavored samples. This study emphasizes that self-correction is not merely a refinement process; rather, it should enhance the reasoning abilities of models through additional training, enabling them to generate high-quality responses directly without further refinement."

We introduce SceneCraft, a novel method for generating detailed indoor scenes that adhere to textual descriptions and spatial layout preferences provided by users. Central to our method is a rendering-based technique, which converts 3D semantic layouts into multi-view 2D proxy maps. Furthermore, we design a semantic and depth conditioned diffusion model to generate multi-view images, which are used to learn a neural radiance field (NeRF) as the final scene representation. Without the constraints of panorama image generation, we surpass previous methods in supporting complicated indoor space generation beyond a single room, even as complicated as a whole multi-bedroom apartment with irregular shapes and layouts. Through experimental analysis, we demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in complex indoor scene generation with diverse textures, consistent geometry, and realistic visual quality.

Balcan et al (2022) proposed an approach to addressing this challenge by defining a notion of robustly-reliable learners that provide per-instance guarantees of correctness under well-defined assumptions, even in the presence of data poisoning attacks. They then give a generic optimal (but computationally inefficient) robustly reliable learner as well as a computationally efficient algorithm for the case of linear separators over log-concave distributions.\n  In this work, we address two challenges left open by Balcan et al (2022). The first is that the definition of robustly-reliable learners in Balcan et al (2022) becomes vacuous for highly-flexible hypothesis classes: if there are two classifiers h_0, h_1 \\in H both with zero error on the training set such that h_0(x) \\neq h_1(x), then a robustly-reliable learner must abstain on x. We address this problem by defining a modified notion of regularized robustly-reliable learners that allows for nontrivial statements in this case. The second is that the generic algorithm of Balcan et al (2022) requires re-running an ERM oracle (essentially, retraining the classifier) on each test point x, which is generally impractical even if ERM can be implemented efficiently. To tackle this problem, we show that at least in certain interesting cases we can design algorithms that can produce their outputs in time sublinear in training time, by using techniques from dynamic algorithm design."

To contend with the limitations, we introduce CATCH, a framework based on frequency patching. We propose to patchify the frequency domain into frequency bands, which enhances its ability to capture fine-grained frequency characteristics. To perceive appropriate channel correlations, we propose a Channel Fusion Module (CFM), which features a patch-wise mask generator and a masked-attention mechanism. Driven by a bi-level multi-objective optimization algorithm, the CFM is encouraged to iteratively discover appropriate patch-wise channel correlations, and to cluster relevant channels while isolating adverse effects from irrelevant channels.

This work introduces a novel multimodal meta-learning method for few-shot ECG question answering, addressing the challenge of limited labeled data while leveraging the rich knowledge encoded within large language models (LLMs). Our LLM-agnostic approach integrates a pre-trained ECG encoder with a frozen LLM (e.g., LLaMA and Gemma) via a trainable fusion module, enabling the language model to reason about ECG data and generate clinically meaningful answers. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior generalization to unseen diagnostic tasks compared to supervised baselines, achieving notable performance even with limited ECG leads.

In this work, we evaluate whether CUDA data remains unlearnable after image sharpening and frequency filtering, finding that this combination of simple transforms improves the utility of CUDA data for training. In particular, we observe a substantial increase in test accuracy over adversarial training for models trained with CUDA unlearnable data from CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-100. In training models to high accuracy using unlearnable data, we underscore the need for ongoing refinement in data poisoning techniques to ensure data privacy.

MoT decouples non-embedding parameters of the model by modality -- including feed-forward networks, attention matrices, and layer normalization -- enabling modality-specific processing with global self-attention over the full input sequence. We evaluate MoT across multiple settings and model scales. In the Chameleon 7B setting (autoregressive text-and-image generation), MoT matches the dense baseline's performance using only 55.8\\% of the FLOPs. When extended to include speech, MoT reaches speech performance comparable to the dense baseline with only 37.2\\% of the FLOPs. In the Transfusion setting, where text and image are trained with different objectives, a 7B MoT model matches the image modality performance of the dense baseline with one third of the FLOPs, and a 760M MoT model outperforms a 1.4B dense baseline across key image generation metrics.

Continuous monitoring of mining conveyor belt work cycles is still at an early stage and requires robust solutions. Recently, an anomaly detection method for duty cycle operations of a mining conveyor belt has been proposed. Based on its limited performance and unevaluated long-term proper operation, this study proposes two novel methods for classifying normal and abnormal duty cycles. The proposed approaches are pattern recognition systems that make use of threshold-based duty-cycle detection mechanisms, manually extracted features, pattern-matching, and supervised tiny machine learning models. The explored low-computational models include decision tree, random forest, extra trees, extreme gradient boosting, Gaussian naive Bayes, and multi-layer perceptron. A comprehensive evaluation of the former and proposed approaches is carried out on two datasets.

The heuristic rule-based approach achieves the highest performance in the same dataset used for algorithm training, with 97.3% for normal cycles and 80.2% for abnormal cycles.

However, recent theoretical studies have shown that, as long as the sample indexes are not used during the learning process, the whole data can be used to learn data representations, meanwhile ensuring control of Type-I errors. The above fact motivates us to use the test set (but without sample indexes) to facilitate the data representation learning in the testing. To this end, we propose a representation-learning two-sample testing (RL-TST) framework. RL-TST first performs purely self-supervised representation learning on the entire dataset to capture inherent representations (IRs) that reflect the underlying data manifold. A discriminative model is then trained on these IRs to learn discriminative representations (DRs), enabling the framework to leverage both the rich structural information from IRs and the discriminative power of DRs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RL-TST outperforms representative approaches by simultaneously using data manifold information in the test set and enhancing test power via finding the DRs with the training set."

Additionally, current ViT-based trackers demand heavy computational resources due to their reliance on the self-attention mechanism. In this paper, we propose a novel pure Mamba-based tracking framework (MambaNUT) that employs a state space model with linear complexity as its backbone, incorporating a single-stream architecture that integrates feature learning and template-search coupling within Vision Mamba. We introduce an adaptive curriculum learning (ACL) approach that dynamically adjusts sampling strategies and loss weights, thereby improving the model's ability of generalization. Our ACL is composed of two levels of curriculum schedulers: (1) sampling scheduler that transforms the data distribution from imbalanced to balanced, as well as from easier (daytime) to harder (nighttime) samples; (2) loss scheduler that dynamically assigns weights based on the size of the training data and IoU of individual instances.

To further study the robustness of 3D spatial reasoning w.r.t. camera 3D viewpoints, our 3DSRBench includes two subsets with 3D spatial reasoning questions on paired images with common and uncommon viewpoints. We benchmark a wide range of open-sourced and proprietary LMMs, uncovering their limitations in various aspects of 3D awareness, such as height, orientation, location, and multi-object reasoning, as well as their degraded performance on images with uncommon camera viewpoints. Our 3DSRBench provide valuable findings and insights about the future development of LMMs with strong 3D reasoning capabilities.

This paper aims to explore the conditions under which these mechanisms are effective in node classification tasks through the lens of Contextual Stochastic Block Models (CSBMs). Our theoretical analysis reveals that incorporating graph attention mechanisms is \\emph{not universally beneficial}. Specifically, by appropriately defining \\emph{structure noise} and \\emph{feature noise} in graphs, we show that graph attention mechanisms can enhance classification performance when structure noise exceeds feature noise. Conversely, when feature noise predominates, simpler graph convolution operations are more effective. Furthermore, we examine the over-smoothing phenomenon and show that, in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, graph convolutional networks suffer from over-smoothing, whereas graph attention mechanisms can effectively resolve this issue. Building on these insights, we propose a novel multi-layer Graph Attention Network (GAT) architecture that significantly outperforms single-layer GATs in achieving \\emph{perfect node classification} in CSBMs, relaxing the SNR requirement from $ \\omega(\\sqrt{\\log n}) $ to $ \\omega(\\sqrt{\\log n} / \\sqrt[3]{n}) $. To our knowledge, this is the first study to delineate the conditions for perfect node classification using multi-layer GATs. Our theoretical contributions are corroborated by extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, highlighting the practical implications of our findings."

We introduce Balanced 3DGS, a Gaussian-wise parallelism rendering with fine-grained tiling approach in 3DGS training process, perfectly solving load-imbalance issues. First, we innovatively introduce the inter-block dynamic workload distribution technique to map workloads to Streaming Multiprocessor(SM) resources within a single GPU dynamically, which constitutes the foundation of load balancing. Second, we are the first to propose the Gaussian-wise parallel rendering technique to significantly reduce workload divergence inside a warp, which serves as a critical component in addressing load imbalance. Based on the above two methods, we further creatively put forward the fine-grained combined load balancing technique to uniformly distribute workload across all SMs, which boosts the forward renderCUDA kernel performance by up to 7.52x.

In this paper, we propose a neural network-based $\\lambda$-domain rate control scheme for deep video compression, which determines the coding parameter $\\lambda$ for each to-be-coded frame based on the rate-distortion-$\\lambda$ (R-D-$\\lambda$) relationships directly learned from uncompressed frames, achieving high rate control accuracy efficiently without the need for pre-encoding. Moreover, this content-aware scheme is able to mitigate inter-frame quality fluctuations and adapt to abrupt changes in video content. Specifically, we introduce two neural network-based predictors to estimate the relationship between bitrate and $\\lambda$, as well as the relationship between distortion and $\\lambda$ for each frame. Then we determine the coding parameter $\\lambda$ for each frame to achieve the target bitrate. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves high rate control accuracy at the mini-GOP level with low time overhead and mitigates inter-frame quality fluctuations across video content of varying resolutions."

Existing approaches such as role assignment and few-shot learning struggle to address these limitations effectively due to their reliance on pre-trained knowledge, limited scalability, and inability to capture nuanced cultural values. To address these issues, we propose ValuesRAG, a novel and effective framework that applies Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with In-Context Learning (ICL) to integrate cultural and demographic knowledge dynamically during text generation. Leveraging the World Values Survey (WVS) dataset, ValuesRAG first generates summaries of values for each individual. We subsequently curate several representative regional datasets to serve as test datasets and retrieve relevant summaries of values based on demographic features, followed by a reranking step to select the top-k relevant summaries. We evaluate ValuesRAG using 6 diverse regional datasets and show that it consistently outperforms baselines: including zero-shot, role-assignment, few-shot, and hybrid methods, both in main experiments and ablation settings. Notably, ValuesRAG achieves the best overall performance over prior methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in fostering culturally aligned and inclusive AI systems.

In this work, we propose a simple technique whereby LMs communicate via activations; concretely, we pause an LM $\\textit{B}$'s computation at an intermediate layer, combine its current activation with another LM $\\textit{A}$'s intermediate activation via some function $\\textit{f}$, then pass $\\textit{f}$'s output into the next layer of $\\textit{B}$ and continue the forward pass till decoding is complete. This approach scales up LMs on new tasks with zero additional parameters and data, and saves a substantial amount of compute over natural language communication. We test our method with various functional forms $\\textit{f}$ on two experimental setups--multi-player coordination games and reasoning benchmarks--and find that it achieves up to $27.0\\%$ improvement over natural language communication across datasets with $<$$1/4$ the compute, illustrating the superiority and robustness of activations as an alternative \"language\" for communication between LMs."

This commentary introduces a conceptual framework--and a demonstration of how it can be implemented--leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to advance cross-language intelligibility assessment of dysarthric speech. Method: We propose a two-tiered conceptual framework consisting of a universal speech model that encodes dysarthric speech into acoustic-phonetic representations, followed by a language-specific intelligibility assessment model that interprets these representations within the phonological or prosodic structures of the target language. We further identify barriers to cross-language intelligibility assessment of dysarthric speech, including data scarcity, annotation complexity, and limited linguistic insights into dysarthric speech, and outline potential AI-driven solutions to overcome these challenges. Conclusion: Advancing cross-language intelligibility assessment of dysarthric speech necessitates models that are both efficient and scalable, yet constrained by linguistic rules to ensure accurate and language-sensitive assessment. Recent advances in AI provide the foundational tools to support this integration, shaping future directions toward generalizable and linguistically informed assessment frameworks."

In this paper, rather than noisy label learning in multiclass classifications, we instead focus on the less explored area of noisy label learning for multilabel classifications. Specifically, we investigate the post-correction of predictions generated from classifiers learned with noisy labels. The reasons are two-fold. Firstly, this approach can directly work with the trained models to save computational resources. Secondly, it could be applied on top of other noisy label correction techniques to achieve further improvements. To handle this problem, we appeal to deep generative approaches that are possible for uncertainty estimation. Our model posits that label noise arises from a stochastic shift in the latent variable, providing a more robust and beneficial means for noisy learning. We develop both unsupervised and semi-supervised learning methods for our model. The extensive empirical study presents solid evidence to that our approach is able to consistently improve the independent models and performs better than a number of existing methods across various noisy label settings.

This includes the LLM, embedding, and ranker models themselves, as well as hyperparameters governing individual RAG components. Yet, collectively optimizing the entire configuration in a RAG or LLM system remains under-explored - especially in multi-objective settings - due to intractably large solution spaces, noisy objective evaluations, and the high cost of evaluations. In this work, we introduce the first approach for multi-objective parameter optimization of cost, latency, safety and alignment over entire LLM and RAG systems. We find that Bayesian optimization methods significantly outperform baseline approaches, obtaining a superior Pareto front on two new RAG benchmark tasks. We conclude our work with important considerations for practitioners who are designing multi-objective RAG systems, highlighting nuances such as how optimal configurations may not generalize across tasks and objectives."

However, continuous human monitoring and intervention can be highly labor-intensive and impractical when deploying a large number of robots. To address this limitation, we propose a method that allows diffusion policies to actively seek human assistance only when necessary, reducing reliance on constant human oversight. To achieve this, we leverage the generative process of diffusion policies to compute an uncertainty-based metric based on which the autonomous agent can decide to request operator assistance at deployment time, without requiring any operator interaction during training. Additionally, we show that the same method can be used for efficient data collection for fine-tuning diffusion policies in order to improve their autonomous performance. Experimental results from simulated and real-world environments demonstrate that our approach enhances policy performance during deployment for a variety of scenarios."

The dataset encodes 37,710 pairwise comparisons across 13,462 images, structured along six criteria - Accessibility, Safety, Comfort, Invitingness, Inclusivity, and Diversity - derived from 634 community-defined concepts. Using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), we fine-tune Stable Diffusion XL to reflect multi-criteria spatial preferences and evaluate the LIVS dataset and the fine-tuned model through four case studies: (1) DPO increases alignment with annotated preferences, particularly when annotation volume is high; (2) preference patterns vary across participant identities, underscoring the need for intersectional data; (3) human-authored prompts generate more distinctive visual outputs than LLM-generated ones, influencing annotation decisiveness; and (4) intersectional groups assign systematically different ratings across criteria, revealing the limitations of single-objective alignment. While DPO improves alignment under specific conditions, the prevalence of neutral ratings indicates that community values are heterogeneous and often ambiguous. LIVS provides a benchmark for developing T2I models that incorporate local, stakeholder-driven preferences, offering a foundation for context-aware alignment in spatial design."

While existing EFCIL methods leverage knowledge distillation to alleviate forgetting, they still face two critical challenges: semantic shift and decision bias. Specifically, the embeddings of old tasks shift in the embedding space after learning new tasks, and the classifier becomes biased towards new tasks due to training solely with new data, thereby hindering the balance between old and new knowledge. To address these issues, we propose the Dual-Projection Shift Estimation and Classifier Reconstruction (DPCR) approach for EFCIL. DPCR effectively estimates semantic shift through a dual-projection, which combines a learnable transformation with a row-space projection to capture both task-wise and category-wise shifts. Furthermore, to mitigate decision bias, DPCR employs ridge regression to reformulate classifier training as a reconstruction process. This reconstruction exploits previous information encoded in covariance and prototype of each class after calibration with estimated shift, thereby reducing decision bias. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, across various datasets, DPCR effectively balances old and new tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art EFCIL methods."

Conformal Prediction (CP) provides a statistically rigorous framework for marginal (average) coverage guarantees but has limited exploration in medical QA. This paper proposes an enhanced CP framework for medical multiple-choice question-answering (MCQA) tasks. By associating the non-conformance score with the frequency score of correct options and leveraging self-consistency, the framework addresses internal model opacity and incorporates a risk control strategy with a monotonic loss function. Evaluated on MedMCQA, MedQA, and MMLU datasets using four off-the-shelf LLMs, the proposed method meets specified error rate guarantees while reducing average prediction set size with increased risk level, offering a promising uncertainty evaluation metric for LLMs."

To address this, we extend the notion of expressivity, defined as the mutual information between learned features and specific attributes, using a secondary neural network to quantify how strongly attributes are encoded. Applying this framework to three ReID models, we find that BMI consistently shows the highest expressivity in the final layers, indicating its dominant role in recognition. In the last attention layer, attributes are ranked as BMI > Pitch > Gender > Yaw, revealing their relative influences in representation learning. Expressivity values also evolve across layers and training epochs, reflecting a dynamic encoding of attributes. These findings demonstrate the central role of body attributes in ReID and establish a principled approach for uncovering attribute driven correlations."

This framework comprises two core tasks: static evaluation, which focuses on evaluating the ability of predefined outpatient referrals, and dynamic evaluation, which evaluates capabilities of refining outpatient referral recommendations through iterative dialogues.

However, existing evaluations primarily assess the final task completion, often degrading assessments to isolated abilities such as visual grounding and visual question answering. Less attention is given to comprehensively and quantitatively analyzing reasoning process in multimodal environments, which is crucial for understanding model behaviors and underlying reasoning mechanisms beyond merely task success. To address this, we introduce MM-Escape, an extensible benchmark for investigating multimodal reasoning, inspired by real-world escape games. MM-Escape emphasizes intermediate model behaviors alongside final task completion. To achieve this, we develop EscapeCraft, a customizable and open environment that enables models to engage in free-form exploration for assessing multimodal reasoning. Extensive experiments show that MLLMs, regardless of scale, can successfully complete the simplest room escape tasks, with some exhibiting human-like exploration strategies. Yet, performance dramatically drops as task difficulty increases. Moreover, we observe that performance bottlenecks vary across models, revealing distinct failure modes and limitations in their multimodal reasoning abilities, such as repetitive trajectories without adaptive exploration, getting stuck in corners due to poor visual spatial awareness, and ineffective use of acquired props, such as the key. We hope our work sheds light on new challenges in multimodal reasoning, and uncovers potential improvements in MLLMs capabilities."

GEMMA-3-27B-IT demonstrated exceptionally high recall despite its smaller parameter count, while LLAMA4-109B showed surprisingly underwhelming performance compared to its predecessor LLAMA3-70B, indicating that larger parameter counts do not guarantee improved classification results.

Existing studies have proposed the uncertain reward models to address reward hacking, however, they often lack systematic or theoretical foundations, failing to model the uncertainty intrinsically emerging from preference data, and thus cannot sufficiently mitigate reward hacking to sustain prolonged RLHF training and exploration. In this paper, we propose a Probabilistic Uncertain Reward Model (PURM), a natural generalization of the classical Bradley-Terry reward model, that can directly learn the reward distribution emerged from the preference data. We theoretically derived PURM's loss function and the uncertainty of the reward distribution. To mitigate reward hacking with PURM, we further introduce an uncertainty-aware penalty into Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), which leverages the learned uncertainty to dynamically balance reward optimization and exploration. Experimental results demonstrate that PURM significantly delays the onset of reward hacking while improving final performance compared with existing methods. We also find that PURM genuinely produce sound reward and uncertainty estimations.

However, their multimodal reasoning capabilities remain on par with fast-thinking models. For instance, GPT-o1's performance on benchmarks like MathVista, MathVerse, and MathVision is similar to fast-thinking models. In this paper, we aim to enhance the slow-thinking capabilities of vision-language models using reinforcement learning (without relying on distillation) to advance the state of the art. First, we adapt the GRPO algorithm with a novel technique called Selective Sample Replay (SSR) to address the vanishing advantages problem. While this approach yields strong performance, the resulting RL-trained models exhibit limited self-reflection or self-verification. To further encourage slow-thinking, we introduce Forced Rethinking, which appends a rethinking trigger token to the end of rollouts in RL training, explicitly enforcing a self-reflection reasoning step. By combining these two techniques, our model, VL-Rethinker, advances state-of-the-art scores on MathVista, MathVerse to achieve 80.4%, 63.5% respectively.

However, they still frequently produce uncompilable output because their next-token inference procedure does not model formal aspects of code. Although constrained decoding is a promising approach to alleviate this issue, it has only been applied to handle either domain-specific languages or syntactic features of general-purpose programming languages. However, LLMs frequently generate code with typing errors, which are beyond the domain of syntax and generally hard to adequately constrain. To address this challenge, we introduce a type-constrained decoding approach that leverages type systems to guide code generation. For this purpose, we develop novel prefix automata and a search over inhabitable types, forming a sound approach to enforce well-typedness on LLM-generated code. We formalize our approach on a foundational simply-typed language and extend it to TypeScript to demonstrate practicality. Our evaluation on the HumanEval and MBPP datasets shows that our approach reduces compilation errors by more than half and significantly increases functional correctness in code synthesis, translation, and repair tasks across LLMs of various sizes and model families, including state-of-the-art open-weight models with more than 30B parameters. The results demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of our approach in constraining LLM code generation with formal rules of type systems."

However, we believe that mastery in geometry requires frictionless integration of all of these skills, from solving problems to visualizing geometric relationships, and finally, crafting tailored problems. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that GeoUni, with only 1.5B parameters, achieves performance comparable to larger models such as DeepSeek-R1 with 671B parameters in geometric reasoning tasks. GeoUni also excels in generating precise geometric diagrams, surpassing both text-to-image models and unified models, including the GPT-4o image generation. Most importantly, GeoUni is the only model capable of successfully generating textual problems with matching diagrams based on specific knowledge points, thus offering a wider range of capabilities that extend beyond current models."

While existing approaches typically employ multi-modal foundation models combining language and vision modalities for prompt-guided anomaly detection, these methods often demand sophisticated prompt engineering and extensive manual tuning. In this paper, we demonstrate that a straightforward nearest-neighbor search framework can surpass state-of-the-art performance in both single-class and multi-class FSAD scenarios. Our proposed method, VisionAD, consists of four simple yet essential components: (1) scalable vision foundation models that extract universal and discriminative features; (2) dual augmentation strategies - support augmentation to enhance feature matching adaptability and query augmentation to address the oversights of single-view prediction; (3) multi-layer feature integration that captures both low-frequency global context and high-frequency local details with minimal computational overhead; and (4) a class-aware visual memory bank enabling efficient one-for-all multi-class detection. Extensive evaluations across MVTec-AD, VisA, and Real-IAD benchmarks demonstrate VisionAD's exceptional performance. Using only 1 normal images as support, our method achieves remarkable image-level AUROC scores of 97.4%, 94.8%, and 70.8% respectively, outperforming current state-of-the-art approaches by significant margins (+1.6%, +3.2%, and +1.4%). The training-free nature and superior few-shot capabilities of VisionAD make it particularly appealing for real-world applications where samples are scarce or expensive to obtain.

Methods: Inspired by the EndoViT study, we adapt the Masked Autoencoder for federated learning, enhancing it with adaptive Sharpness-Aware Minimization (FedSAM) and Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA). Our model is pretrained on the Endo700k dataset collection and later fine-tuned and evaluated for tasks such as Semantic Segmentation, Action Triplet Recognition, and Surgical Phase Recognition. Results: Our findings demonstrate that integrating adaptive FedSAM into the federated MAE approach improves pretraining, leading to a reduction in reconstruction loss per patch. The application of FL-EndoViT in surgical downstream tasks results in performance comparable to CEN-EndoViT. Furthermore, FL-EndoViT exhibits advantages over CEN-EndoViT in surgical scene segmentation when data is limited and in action triplet recognition when large datasets are used. Conclusion: These findings highlight the potential of federated learning for privacy-preserving training of surgical foundation models, offering a robust and generalizable solution for surgical data science. Effective collaboration requires adapting federated learning methods, such as the integration of FedSAM, which can accommodate the inherent data heterogeneity across institutions. In future, exploring FL in video-based models may enhance these capabilities by incorporating spatiotemporal dynamics crucial for real-world surgical environments."

A recent discovery, termed watermark radioactivity, reveals that watermarks embedded in teacher models can be inherited by student models through knowledge distillation. On the positive side, this inheritance allows for the detection of unauthorized knowledge distillation by identifying watermark traces in student models. However, the robustness of watermarks against scrubbing attacks and their unforgeability in the face of spoofing attacks under unauthorized knowledge distillation remain largely unexplored. Existing watermark attack methods either assume access to model internals or fail to simultaneously support both scrubbing and spoofing attacks. In this work, we propose Contrastive Decoding-Guided Knowledge Distillation (CDG-KD), a unified framework that enables bidirectional attacks under unauthorized knowledge distillation. Our approach employs contrastive decoding to extract corrupted or amplified watermark texts via comparing outputs from the student model and weakly watermarked references, followed by bidirectional distillation to train new student models capable of watermark removal and watermark forgery, respectively. Extensive experiments show that CDG-KD effectively performs attacks while preserving the general performance of the distilled model. Our findings underscore critical need for developing watermarking schemes that are robust and unforgeable."

Leveraging this PRM, we then adapt Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to operate at the reasoning step level. Unlike traditional reinforcement learning focused on maximizing a single reward, GFlowNets naturally sample diverse, high-quality solutions proportional to their rewards, as measured by our PRM. Empirical evaluation shows strong improvements in both accuracy and solution diversity on challenging mathematical benchmarks (e.g., +2.59% absolute accuracy on MATH Level 5 for Llama3.2-3B), with effective generalization to unseen datasets (+9.4% absolute on SAT MATH).

To bridge this gap, we present Nexus-Gen, a unified model that synergizes the language reasoning capabilities of LLMs with the image synthesis power of diffusion models. To align the embedding space of the LLM and diffusion model, we conduct a dual-phase alignment training process. (1) The autoregressive LLM learns to predict image embeddings conditioned on multimodal inputs, while (2) the vision decoder is trained to reconstruct high-fidelity images from these embeddings. During training the LLM, we identified a critical discrepancy between the autoregressive paradigm's training and inference phases, where error accumulation in continuous embedding space severely degrades generation quality. To avoid this issue, we introduce a prefilled autoregression strategy that prefills input sequence with position-embedded special tokens instead of continuous embeddings. Through dual-phase training, Nexus-Gen has developed the integrated capability to comprehensively address the image understanding, generation and editing tasks.

To address this limitation, we propose Image-Event Fusion for Video Anomaly Detection (IEF-VAD), a framework that synthesizes event representations directly from RGB videos and fuses them with image features through a principled, uncertainty-aware process. The system (i) models heavy-tailed sensor noise with a Student`s-t likelihood, deriving value-level inverse-variance weights via a Laplace approximation; (ii) applies Kalman-style frame-wise updates to balance modalities over time; and (iii) iteratively refines the fused latent state to erase residual cross-modal noise. Without any dedicated event sensor or frame-level labels, IEF-VAD sets a new state of the art across multiple real-world anomaly detection benchmarks. These findings highlight the utility of synthetic event representations in emphasizing motion cues that are often underrepresented in RGB frames, enabling accurate and robust video understanding across diverse applications without requiring dedicated event sensors.

While diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in Text-to-X (e.g., vision and audio data) generation, their use in time series generation remains in its nascent stages. Existing approaches face two critical limitations: (1) the lack of systematic exploration of general-proposed time series captions, which are often domain-specific and struggle with generalization; and (2) the inability to generate time series of arbitrary lengths, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios. In this work, we first categorize time series captions into three levels: point-level, fragment-level, and instance-level. Additionally, we introduce a new fragment-level dataset containing over 600,000 high-resolution time series-text pairs. Second, we propose Text-to-Series (T2S), a diffusion-based framework that bridges the gap between natural language and time series in a domain-agnostic manner. T2S employs a length-adaptive variational autoencoder to encode time series of varying lengths into consistent latent embeddings. On top of that, T2S effectively aligns textual representations with latent embeddings by utilizing Flow Matching and employing Diffusion Transformer as the denoiser. We train T2S in an interleaved paradigm across multiple lengths, allowing it to generate sequences of any desired length. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that T2S achieves state-of-the-art performance across 13 datasets spanning 12 domains."

The FeTA Challenge 2024 advanced automated fetal brain MRI analysis by introducing biometry prediction as a new task alongside tissue segmentation. For the first time, our diverse multi-centric test set included data from a new low-field (0.55T) MRI dataset. Evaluation metrics were also expanded to include the topology-specific Euler characteristic difference (ED). Sixteen teams submitted segmentation methods, most of which performed consistently across both high- and low-field scans. However, longitudinal trends indicate that segmentation accuracy may be reaching a plateau, with results now approaching inter-rater variability. The ED metric uncovered topological differences that were missed by conventional metrics, while the low-field dataset achieved the highest segmentation scores, highlighting the potential of affordable imaging systems when paired with high-quality reconstruction. Seven teams participated in the biometry task, but most methods failed to outperform a simple baseline that predicted measurements based solely on gestational age, underscoring the challenge of extracting reliable biometric estimates from image data alone. Domain shift analysis identified image quality as the most significant factor affecting model generalization, with super-resolution pipelines also playing a substantial role. Other factors, such as gestational age, pathology, and acquisition site, had smaller, though still measurable, effects. Overall, FeTA 2024 offers a comprehensive benchmark for multi-class segmentation and biometry estimation in fetal brain MRI, underscoring the need for data-centric approaches, improved topological evaluation, and greater dataset diversity to enable clinically robust and generalizable AI tools."

The main contribution of the work is the low-rank model for the compact joint representation of the family of diffeomorphisms, parameterized by the motion phases. The diffeomorphism at a specific motion phase is obtained by integrating a parametric velocity field along a path connecting the reference template phase to the motion phase. The velocity field at different phases is represented using a low-rank model. The static template and the low-rank motion model parameters are learned directly from the k-space data in an unsupervised fashion.

The most common evaluation framework for MI attacks/defenses relies on an evaluation model that has been utilized to assess progress across almost all MI attacks and defenses proposed in recent years. In this paper, for the first time, we present an in-depth study of MI evaluation. Firstly, we construct the first comprehensive human-annotated dataset of MI attack samples, based on 28 setups of different MI attacks, defenses, private and public datasets. Secondly, using our dataset, we examine the accuracy of the MI evaluation framework and reveal that it suffers from a significant number of false positives. These findings raise questions about the previously reported success rates of SOTA MI attacks. Thirdly, we analyze the causes of these false positives, design controlled experiments, and discover the surprising effect of Type I adversarial features on MI evaluation, as well as adversarial transferability, highlighting a relationship between two previously distinct research areas. Our findings suggest that the performance of SOTA MI attacks has been overestimated, with the actual privacy leakage being significantly less than previously reported. In conclusion, we highlight critical limitations in the widely used MI evaluation framework and present our methods to mitigate false positive rates. We remark that prior research has shown that Type I adversarial attacks are very challenging, with no existing solution. Therefore, we urge to consider human evaluation as a primary MI evaluation framework rather than merely a supplement as in previous MI research. We also encourage further work on developing more robust and reliable automatic evaluation frameworks."

However, it is often the case that data in spectroscopy is scarce, and this usually causes severe overfitting problems with deep learning methods. Traditional machine learning methods are viable when datasets are smaller, but the accuracy and applicability of these methods is generally more limited. We introduce a deep learning method for classification of molecular spectra based on learning integral operators via integral equations of the first kind, which results in an algorithm that is less affected by overfitting issues on small datasets, compared to other deep learning models. The problem formulation of the deep learning approach is based on inverse problems, which have traditionally found important applications in spectroscopy. We perform experiments on real world data to showcase our algorithm. It is seen that the model outperforms traditional machine learning approaches such as decision tree and support vector machine, and for small datasets it outperforms other deep learning models. Therefore, our methodology leverages the power of deep learning, still maintaining the performance when the available data is very limited, which is one of the main issues that deep learning faces in spectroscopy, where datasets are often times of small size."

In this study, we propose Motion-Aware Image SYnthesis (MAISY) which initially characterize motion and then uses it for correction by: (a) leveraging the foundation model Segment Anything Model (SAM), to dynamically learn spatial patterns along anatomical boundaries where motion artifacts are most pronounced and, (b) introducing the Variance-Selective SSIM (VS-SSIM) loss which adaptively emphasizes spatial regions with high pixel variance to preserve essential anatomical details during artifact correction.

The conventional approach to assessing muscle tissue regeneration involves whole-slide imaging and expert visual inspection of the recovery stages based on the morphological information of cells and fibers. There is a need to replace these tasks with automated methods incorporating machine learning techniques to ensure a quantitative and objective analysis. Given the limited availability of fully labeled data, a possible approach is Learning from Label Proportions (LLP), a weakly supervised learning method using class label proportions. However, current LLP methods have two limitations: (1) they cannot adapt the feature extractor for muscle tissues, and (2) they treat the classes representing recovery stages and cell morphological changes as nominal, resulting in the loss of ordinal information. To address these issues, we propose Ordinal Scale Learning from Similarity Proportion (OSLSP), which uses a similarity proportion loss derived from two bag combinations. OSLSP can update the feature extractor by using class proportion attention to the ordinal scale of the class. Our model with OSLSP outperforms large-scale pre-trained and fine-tuning models in classification tasks of skeletal muscle recovery stages."

While existing methods leverage multiple depth cues (e.g., estimating depth uncertainty, modeling depth error) to improve depth accuracy, they overlook that accurate depth prediction requires conditioning on other 3D attributes, as these attributes are intrinsically inter-correlated through the 3D to 2D projection, which ultimately limits overall accuracy and stability. Inspired by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) in large language models (LLMs), this paper proposes MonoCoP, which leverages a Chain-of-Prediction (CoP) to predict attributes sequentially and conditionally via three key designs. First, it employs a lightweight AttributeNet (AN) for each 3D attribute to learn attribute-specific features. Next, MonoCoP constructs an explicit chain to propagate these learned features from one attribute to the next. Finally, MonoCoP uses a residual connection to aggregate features for each attribute along the chain, ensuring that later attribute predictions are conditioned on all previously processed attributes without forgetting the features of earlier ones. Experimental results show that our MonoCoP achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance on the KITTI leaderboard without requiring additional data and further surpasses existing methods on the Waymo and nuScenes frontal datasets."

Nevertheless, early diagnosis of cancer is a major challenge, particularly in low-resource settings where access to medical resources and trained radiologists is limited. The objective of this study is to propose an automated end-to-end deep learning-based framework for the early detection and classification of lung nodules, specifically for low-resource settings. The proposed framework consists of three stages: lung segmentation using a modified 3D U-Net named 3D Res-U-Net, nodule detection using YOLO-v5, and classification with a Vision Transformer-based architecture. We evaluated the proposed framework on a publicly available dataset, LUNA16. The proposed framework's performance was measured using the respective domain's evaluation matrices. The proposed framework achieved a 98.82% lung segmentation dice score while detecting the lung nodule with 0.76 mAP@50 from the segmented lung, at a low false-positive rate. The performance of both networks of the proposed framework was compared with other studies and found to outperform them regarding segmentation and detection accuracy. Additionally, our proposed Vision transformer network obtained an accuracy of 93.57%, which is 1.21% higher than the state-of-the-art networks. Our proposed end-to-end deep learning-based framework can effectively segment lungs, and detect and classify lung nodules, specifically in low-resource settings with limited access to radiologists. The proposed framework outperforms existing studies regarding all the respective evaluation metrics. The proposed framework can potentially improve the accuracy and efficiency of lung cancer screening in low-resource settings, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes."

In order to solve this vector-valued optimisation problem, practitioners often appeal to the use of scalarisation functions in order to transform the multi-objective problem into a collection of single-objective problems. This set of scalarised problems can then be solved using traditional single-objective optimisation techniques. In this work, we formalise this convention into a general mathematical framework. We show how this strategy effectively recasts the original multi-objective optimisation problem into a single-objective optimisation problem defined over sets. An appropriate class of objective functions for this new problem are the R2 utilities, which are utility functions that are defined as a weighted integral over the scalarised optimisation problems. As part of our work, we show that these utilities are monotone and submodular set functions which can be optimised effectively using greedy optimisation algorithms. We then analyse the performance of these greedy algorithms both theoretically and empirically. Our analysis largely focusses on Bayesian optimisation, which is a popular probabilistic framework for black-box optimisation."

To circumvent the shortage of seed alignments provided for training, recent EA models utilize pseudo-labeling strategies to iteratively add unaligned entity pairs predicted with high confidence to the seed alignments for model training. However, the adverse impact of confirmation bias during pseudo-labeling has been largely overlooked, thus hindering entity alignment performance. To systematically combat confirmation bias for pseudo-labeling-based entity alignment, we propose a Unified Pseudo-Labeling framework for Entity Alignment (UPL-EA) that explicitly eliminates pseudo-labeling errors to boost the accuracy of entity alignment. UPL-EA consists of two complementary components: (1) Optimal Transport (OT)-based pseudo-labeling uses discrete OT modeling as an effective means to determine entity correspondences and reduce erroneous matches across two KGs. An effective criterion is derived to infer pseudo-labeled alignments that satisfy one-to-one correspondences; (2) Parallel pseudo-label ensembling refines pseudo-labeled alignments by combining predictions over multiple models independently trained in parallel. The ensembled pseudo-labeled alignments are thereafter used to augment seed alignments to reinforce subsequent model training for alignment inference. The effectiveness of UPL-EA in eliminating pseudo-labeling errors is both theoretically supported and experimentally validated. Our extensive results and in-depth analyses demonstrate the superiority of UPL-EA over 15 competitive baselines and its utility as a general pseudo-labeling framework for entity alignment."

Despite their prevalence, there are no current approaches that jointly estimate the location and size of the discontinuity set in a one-shot approach with statistical guarantees. We therefore introduce Free Discontinuity Regression (FDR), a fully nonparametric estimator that simultaneously (i) smooths a regression surface, (ii) segments it into contiguous regions, and (iii) provably recovers the precise locations and sizes of its jumps. By extending a convex relaxation of the Mumford-Shah functional to random spatial sampling and correlated noise, FDR overcomes the fixed-grid and i.i.d. noise assumptions of classical image-segmentation approaches, thus enabling its application to real-world data of any dimension. This yields the first identification and uniform consistency results for multivariate jump surfaces: under mild SBV regularity, the estimated function, its discontinuity set, and all jump sizes converge to their true population counterparts. Hyperparameters are selected automatically from the data using Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate, and large-scale simulations up to three dimensions validate the theoretical results and demonstrate good finite-sample performance. Applying FDR to an internet shutdown in India reveals a 25-35% reduction in economic activity around the estimated shutdown boundaries-much larger than previous estimates. By unifying smoothing, segmentation, and effect-size recovery in a general statistical setting, FDR turns free-discontinuity ideas into a practical tool with formal guarantees for modern multivariate data."

While these assumptions facilitate efficient algorithms, they cause analysis biases and subsequent forecast degradations. Non-parametric, particle-based DA algorithms have superior accuracy, but their application to high-dimensional models still poses operational challenges. Drawing inspiration from recent advances in the field of generative artificial intelligence (AI), this article introduces a new nonlinear estimation theory which attempts to bridge the existing gap in DA methodology. Specifically, a Conjugate Transform Filter (CTF) is derived and shown to generalize the celebrated Kalman filter to arbitrarily non-Gaussian distributions. The new filter has several desirable properties, such as its ability to preserve statistical relationships in the prior state and convergence to highly accurate observations. An ensemble approximation of the new theory (ECTF) is also presented and validated using idealized statistical experiments that feature bounded quantities with non-Gaussian distributions, a prevalent challenge in Earth system models. Results from these experiments indicate that the greatest benefits from ECTF occur when observation errors are small relative to the forecast uncertainty and when state variables exhibit strong nonlinear dependencies. Ultimately, the new filtering theory offers exciting avenues for improving conventional DA algorithms through their principled integration with AI techniques."

However, their privacy guarantees are only considered robust when models satisfy Differential Privacy (DP). Alas, this is not a ubiquitous standard, as many leading companies (and, in fact, research papers) use ad-hoc privacy metrics based on testing the statistical similarity between synthetic and real data.\n  In this paper, we examine the privacy metrics used in real-world synthetic data deployments and demonstrate their unreliability in several ways. First, we provide counter-examples where severe privacy violations occur even if the privacy tests pass and instantiate accurate membership and attribute inference attacks with minimal cost. We then introduce ReconSyn, a reconstruction attack that generates multiple synthetic datasets that are considered private by the metrics but actually leak information unique to individual records. We show that ReconSyn recovers 78-100% of the outliers in the train data with only black-box access to a single fitted generative model and the privacy metrics. In the process, we show that applying DP only to the model does not mitigate this attack, as using privacy metrics breaks the end-to-end DP pipeline."

The agent under consideration is a price taker who has access only to the stock and factor value processes and the instantaneous volatility. We propose an auxiliary problem in which the agent can invoke policy randomization according to a specific class of Gaussian distributions, and prove that the mean of its optimal Gaussian policy solves the original Merton problem. With randomized policies, we are in the realm of continuous-time reinforcement learning (RL) recently developed in Wang et al. (2020) and Jia and Zhou (2022a, 2022b, 2023), enabling us to solve the auxiliary problem in a data-driven way without having to estimate the model primitives. Specifically, we establish a policy improvement theorem based on which we design both online and offline actor-critic RL algorithms for learning Merton's strategies. A key insight from this study is that RL in general and policy randomization in particular are useful beyond the purpose for exploration -- they can be employed as a technical tool to solve a problem that cannot be otherwise solved by mere deterministic policies. At last, we carry out both simulation and empirical studies in a stochastic volatility environment to demonstrate the decisive outperformance of the devised RL algorithms in comparison to the conventional model-based, plug-in method."

In this study, we propose WaveSleepNet, an interpretable neural network for sleep staging that reasons in a similar way to sleep experts. In this network, we utilize the latent space representations generated during training to identify characteristic wave prototypes corresponding to different sleep stages. The feature representation of an input signal is segmented into patches within the latent space, each of which is compared against the learned wave prototypes. The proximity between these patches and the wave prototypes is quantified through scores, indicating the prototypes' presence and relative proportion within the signal. The scores are served as the decision-making criteria for final sleep staging. During training, an ensemble of loss functions is employed for the prototypes' diversity and robustness. Furthermore, the learned wave prototypes are visualized by analysing occlusion sensitivity. The efficacy of WaveSleepNet is validated across three public datasets, achieving sleep staging performance that are on par with the state-of-the-art models when several WaveSleepNets are combine into a larger network. A detailed case study examined the decision-making process of the WaveSleepNet which aligns closely with American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) manual guidelines. Another case study systematically explained the misidentified reason behind each sleep stage. WaveSleepNet's transparent process provides specialists with direct access to the physiological significance of its criteria, allowing for future adaptation or enrichment by sleep experts."

When a model exhibits a BP, its parameter optimization landscape becomes exponentially flat and featureless as the problem size increases. Importantly, all the moving pieces of an algorithm -- choices of ansatz, initial state, observable, loss function and hardware noise -- can lead to BPs when ill-suited. Due to the significant impact of BPs on trainability, researchers have dedicated considerable effort to develop theoretical and heuristic methods to understand and mitigate their effects. As a result, the study of BPs has become a thriving area of research, influencing and cross-fertilizing other fields such as quantum optimal control, tensor networks, and learning theory.

Instead, we propose a different distributional perspective, where we seek to find an idealized data distribution which maximizes a pretrained model's performance. This can be formalized via the optimization of a loss's risk with a $\\varphi$-divergence regularization term. Through this idealized distribution, a rejection decision can be made by utilizing the density ratio between this distribution and the data distribution.

Leveraging a heterogeneous graph neural network (GNN) with graph-level classification, XG-NID uniquely enables real-time inference while effectively capturing the intricate relationships between flow and packet payload data. Unlike traditional GNN-based methodologies that predominantly analyze historical data, XG-NID is designed to accommodate the heterogeneous nature of network traffic, providing a robust and real-time defense mechanism. Our framework extends beyond mere classification; it integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate detailed, human-readable explanations and suggest potential remedial actions, ensuring that the insights produced are both actionable and comprehensible. Additionally, we introduce a new set of flow features based on temporal information, further enhancing the contextual and explainable inferences provided by our model. To facilitate practical application and accessibility, we developed \"GNN4ID,\" an open-source tool that enables the extraction and transformation of raw network traffic into the proposed heterogeneous graph structure, seamlessly integrating flow and packet-level data.

Optimal transformations between the images are sought as minimisers of an integral functional among orientation-preserving homeomorphisms. The existence of minimisers is proved under natural coercivity and polyconvexity conditions, assuming only that the intensity functions are bounded measurable. Variants of the existence theorem are also proved, first under the constraint that finite sets of landmark points in the two images are mapped one to the other, and second when one image is to be compared to an unknown part of another.\n  The question is studied as to whether for images related by an affine mapping the unique minimiser is given by that affine mapping. For a natural class of functional integrands an example is given guaranteeing that this property holds for pairs of images in which the second is a scaling of the first by a constant factor. However for the property to hold for arbitrary pairs of affinely related images it is shown that the integrand has to depend on the gradient of the transformation as a convex function of its determinant alone. This suggests a new model in which the integrand depends also on second derivatives of the transformation, and an example is given for which both existence of minimisers is assured and the above property holds for all pairs of affinely related images."

In this paper, we aim to bridge the gaps between theory and practice. First, we demonstrate that selectivity predictors induced by signed measures are learnable, which relaxes the reliance on probability measures in SOTA theory. More importantly, beyond the PAC learning framework (which only allows us to characterize how the model behaves when both training and test workloads are drawn from the same distribution), we establish, under mild assumptions, that selectivity predictors from this class exhibit favorable out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization error bounds.\n  These theoretical advances provide us with a better understanding of both the in-distribution and OOD generalization capabilities of query-driven selectivity learning, and facilitate the design of two general strategies to improve OOD generalization for existing query-driven selectivity models. We empirically verify that our techniques help query-driven selectivity models generalize significantly better to OOD queries both in terms of prediction accuracy and query latency performance, while maintaining their superior in-distribution generalization performance."

In 2019 Casel et al. showed that determining the locality of an arbitrary pattern is NP-complete. Inspired by hierarchical clustering, we extend the notion to coloured graphs, i.e., given a coloured graph determine an enumeration of the colours such that colouring the graph stepwise according to the enumeration leads to as few clusters as possible. Next to first theoretical results on graph classes, we propose a priority search algorithm to compute the $k$-locality of a graph. The algorithm is optimal in the number of marking prefix expansions, and is faster by orders of magnitude than an exhaustive search.

Despite these advancements in the past few years, LLMs have shown considerable vulnerabilities, particularly to prompt injection and jailbreaking attacks. This review analyzes the state of research on these vulnerabilities and presents available defense strategies. We roughly categorize attack approaches into prompt-based, model-based, multimodal, and multilingual, covering techniques such as adversarial prompting, backdoor injections, and cross-modality exploits. We also review various defense mechanisms, including prompt filtering, transformation, alignment techniques, multi-agent defenses, and self-regulation, evaluating their strengths and shortcomings. We also discuss key metrics and benchmarks used to assess LLM safety and robustness, noting challenges like the quantification of attack success in interactive contexts and biases in existing datasets. Identifying current research gaps, we suggest future directions for resilient alignment strategies, advanced defenses against evolving attacks, automation of jailbreak detection, and consideration of ethical and societal impacts. This review emphasizes the need for continued research and cooperation within the AI community to enhance LLM security and ensure their safe deployment."

Deep learning approaches show promise for automating these tasks, but progress has been limited by the absence of large-scale, annotated datasets. Here, we present CirrMRI600+, the first comprehensive dataset comprising 628 high-resolution abdominal MRI scans (310 T1-weighted and 318 T2-weighted sequences, totaling nearly 40,000 annotated slices) with expert-validated segmentation labels for cirrhotic livers. The dataset includes demographic information, clinical parameters, and histopathological validation where available.

This is mainly due to the issue of modeling observations inherent in generative probabilistic models. In this paper, we introduce a new algorithm for prediction with the PMC. On the one hand, this algorithm allows circumventing the feature problem, thus fully exploiting the capabilities of the PMC. On the other hand, it enables the PMC to extend any predictive model by introducing hidden states, updated at each time step, and allowing the introduction of non-stationarity for any model. We apply the PMC with its new algorithm for volatility forecasting, which we compare to the highly popular GARCH(1,1) and feedforward neural models across numerous pairs. This is particularly relevant given the regime changes that we can observe in volatility. For each scenario, our algorithm enhances the performance of the extended model, demonstrating the value of our approach."

However, these designs are limited in practical applications as predictors cannot be directly implemented, but require numerical approximation schemes, which become computationally prohibitive when system dynamics are expensive to compute. To address this challenge, we recast the predictor design as an operator learning problem, and learn the predictor mapping via a neural operator. We prove the existence of an arbitrarily accurate neural operator approximation of the predictor operator. Under the approximated predictor, we achieve semiglobal practical stability of the closed-loop nonlinear delay system. The estimate is semiglobal in a unique sense - one can enlarge the set of initial states as desired, though this increases the difficulty of training a neural operator, which appears practically in the stability estimate. Furthermore, our analysis holds for any black-box predictor satisfying the universal approximation error bound. We demonstrate the approach by controlling a 5-link robotic manipulator with different neural operator models, achieving significant speedups compared to classic predictor feedback schemes while maintaining closed-loop stability."

In particular, two-photon holographic optogenetics now enables precise photostimulation of experimenter-specified groups of individual neurons, while simultaneous two-photon calcium imaging enables the measurement of ongoing and induced activity across the neural population. Despite the enormous space of potential photostimulation patterns and the time-consuming nature of photostimulation experiments, very little algorithmic work has been done to determine the most effective photostimulation patterns for identifying the neural population dynamics. Here, we develop methods to efficiently select which neurons to stimulate such that the resulting neural responses will best inform a dynamical model of the neural population activity. Using neural population responses to photostimulation in mouse motor cortex, we demonstrate the efficacy of a low-rank linear dynamical systems model, and develop an active learning procedure which takes advantage of low-rank structure to determine informative photostimulation patterns. We demonstrate our approach on both real and synthetic data, obtaining in some cases as much as a two-fold reduction in the amount of data required to reach a given predictive power. Our active stimulation design method is based on a novel active learning procedure for low-rank regression, which may be of independent interest."

In this work, we introduce AirMorph, a robust, end-to-end deep learning pipeline enabling fully automatic and comprehensive airway anatomical labeling at lobar, segmental, and subsegmental resolutions that can be used to create digital atlases of the lung. Evaluated across large-scale multi-center datasets comprising diverse pulmonary conditions, the AirMorph consistently outperformed existing segmentation and labeling methods in terms of accuracy, topological consistency, and completeness. To simplify clinical interpretation, we further introduce a compact anatomical signature quantifying critical morphological airway features, including stenosis, ectasia, tortuosity, divergence, length, and complexity. When applied to various pulmonary diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis, emphysema, atelectasis, consolidation, and reticular opacities, it demonstrates strong discriminative power, revealing disease-specific morphological patterns with high interpretability and explainability.

Even when the number of clusters $K$ is known, this ambiguity often still exists, particularly when there is variation in density among different clusters, and clusters have multiple relatively separated regions of high density. In this paper we propose an information-theoretic characterization of when a $K$-clustering is ambiguous, and design an algorithm that recovers the clustering whenever it is unambiguous. This characterization formalizes the situation when two high density regions within a cluster are separable enough that they look more like two distinct clusters than two truly distinct clusters in the $K$-clustering. The algorithm first identifies $K$ partial clusters (or \"seeds\") using a density-based approach, and then adds unclustered points to the initial $K$ partial clusters in a greedy manner to form a complete clustering. We implement and test a version of the algorithm that is modified to effectively handle overlapping clusters, and observe that it requires little parameter selection and displays improved performance on many datasets compared to widely used algorithms for non-convex cluster recovery."

The intrinsic complexity of AC-OPF has fueled a growing interest in the development of optimization proxies for the problem, i.e., machine learning models that predict high-quality, close-to-optimal solutions. More recently, dual conic proxy architectures have been proposed, which combine machine learning and convex relaxations of AC-OPF, to provide valid certificates of optimality using learning-based methods. Building on this methodology, this paper proposes, for the first time, a dual conic proxy architecture for the semidefinite (SDP) relaxation of AC-OPF problems. Although the SDP relaxation is stronger than the second-order cone relaxation considered in previous work, its practical use has been hindered by its computational cost. The proposed method combines a neural network with a differentiable dual completion strategy that leverages the structure of the dual SDP problem. This approach guarantees dual feasibility, and therefore valid dual bounds, while providing orders of magnitude of speedups compared to interior-point algorithms. The paper also leverages self-supervised learning, which alleviates the need for time-consuming data generation and allows to train the proposed models efficiently. Numerical experiments are presented on several power grid benchmarks with up to 500 buses. The results demonstrate that the proposed SDP-based proxies can outperform weaker conic relaxations, while providing several orders of magnitude speedups compared to a state-of-the-art interior-point SDP solver."

RINS is a particular form of recursive depth that significantly outperforms +55 other variants, including the recent \"repeat-all-over\" (RAO) strategy in Mobile LLM (Liu et al., 2024) and latent recurrent thinking (Geiping et al., 2025). Unlike prior works, we carry out our comparisons on a compute-matched regime, and demonstrate that for a fixed model size and training compute budget, RINS substantially improves language modeling performance. It also generalizes beyond pure language tasks, delivering gains in multimodal systems, including a +2% improvement in 0-shot ImageNet accuracy for SigLIP-B/16. Additionally, by deriving data scaling laws, we show that RINS improves both the asymptotic performance limits and the scaling exponents. More importantly, with light-weight (linear) adapters (comprising <1% of model parameters) and stochastic dropout, RINS offers a no-regret strategy, meaning that RINS-enabled pretraining improves performance in language modeling even when recursive depth is not applied at inference time. This corresponds to improving performance on a training compute-, parameter-, and inference-matched regime, suggesting its potential as a viable component of LLM pretraining!"

Most of these approaches use position-based control, where policies output target joint angles that must be processed by a low-level controller (e.g., PD or impedance controllers) to compute joint torques. Although impressive results have been achieved in controlled real-world scenarios, these methods often struggle with compliance and adaptability when encountering environments or disturbances unseen during training, potentially resulting in extreme or unsafe behaviors. Inspired by how animals achieve smooth and adaptive movements by controlling muscle extension and contraction, torque-based policies offer a promising alternative by enabling precise and direct control of the actuators in torque space. In principle, this approach facilitates more effective interactions with the environment, resulting in safer and more adaptable behaviors. However, challenges such as a highly nonlinear state space and inefficient exploration during training have hindered their broader adoption. To address these limitations, we propose SATA, a bio-inspired framework that mimics key biomechanical principles and adaptive learning mechanisms observed in animal locomotion. Our approach effectively addresses the inherent challenges of learning torque-based policies by significantly improving early-stage exploration, leading to high-performance final policies. Remarkably, our method achieves zero-shot sim-to-real transfer. Our experimental results indicate that SATA demonstrates remarkable compliance and safety, even in challenging environments such as soft/slippery terrain or narrow passages, and under significant external disturbances, highlighting its potential for practical deployments in human-centric and safety-critical scenarios."

This allows it to adaptively focus on the market microstructure, making it particularly effective for longer-horizon predictions and volatile market conditions. We also introduce a new labeling method that improves on previous ones, removing the horizon bias.

Additionally, we empirically show how stock price predictability has declined over time, -6.68 in F1-score, highlighting the growing market efficiency. Predictability must be considered in relation to transaction costs, so we experimented with defining trends using an average spread, reflecting the primary transaction cost. The resulting performance deterioration underscores the complexity of translating trend classification into profitable trading strategies. We argue that our work provides new insights into the evolving landscape of stock price trend prediction and sets a strong foundation for future advancements in financial AI. We release the code at https://github.com/LeonardoBerti00/TLOB."

Despite their many advantages, we show that the current Elo-based rating systems can be susceptible to and even reinforce biases in data, intentional or accidental, due to their sensitivity to redundancies. To address this issue, we propose evaluation as a 3-player game, and introduce novel game-theoretic solution concepts to ensure robustness to redundancy.

However, achieving accurate vehicular channel prediction is challenging due to significant Doppler effects and rapid channel variations resulting from high-speed vehicle movement and complex propagation environments. In this paper, we propose a novel delay-Doppler (DD) domain channel prediction framework tailored for high-mobility vehicular networks. By transforming the channel representation into the DD domain, we obtain an intuitive, sparse, and stable depiction that closely aligns with the underlying physical propagation processes, effectively reducing the complex vehicular channel to a set of time-series parameters with enhanced predictability. Furthermore, we leverage the large artificial intelligence (AI) model to predict these DD-domain time-series parameters, capitalizing on their advanced ability to model temporal correlations. The zero-shot capability of the pre-trained large AI model facilitates accurate channel predictions without requiring task-specific training, while subsequent fine-tuning on specific vehicular channel data further improves prediction accuracy. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our DD-domain channel prediction framework and the superior accuracy of the large AI model in predicting time-series channel parameters, thereby highlighting the potential of our approach for robust vehicular communication systems."

Recent breakthroughs in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have shown significant promise in development of advanced Deep Learning (DL) architectures for breast cancer diagnosis through mammography. In this context, the paper focuses on the integration of AI within a Human-Centric workflow to enhance breast cancer diagnostics. Key challenges are, however, largely overlooked such as reliance on detailed tumor annotations and susceptibility to missing views, particularly during test time. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid, multi-scale and multi-view Swin Transformer-based framework (MSMV-Swin) that enhances diagnostic robustness and accuracy. The proposed MSMV-Swin framework is designed to work as a decision-support tool, helping radiologists analyze multi-view mammograms more effectively. More specifically, the MSMV-Swin framework leverages the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to isolate the breast lobe, reducing background noise and enabling comprehensive feature extraction. The multi-scale nature of the proposed MSMV-Swin framework accounts for tumor-specific regions as well as the spatial characteristics of tissues surrounding the tumor, capturing both localized and contextual information. The integration of contextual and localized data ensures that MSMV-Swin's outputs align with the way radiologists interpret mammograms, fostering better human-AI interaction and trust. A hybrid fusion structure is then designed to ensure robustness against missing views, a common occurrence in clinical practice when only a single mammogram view is available."

However, such one-model-for-a-task paradigm often lacks generalizability and leaves significant room for performance improvement. Additionally, existing molecular characterization methods are not well-suited for the unique tasks associated with natural products. To address these limitations, we have pre-trained a foundation model for natural products based on their unique properties. Our approach employs a novel pretraining strategy that is especially tailored to natural products. By incorporating contrastive learning and masked graph learning objectives, we emphasize evolutional information from molecular scaffolds while capturing side-chain information. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in various downstream tasks related to natural product mining and drug discovery. We first compare taxonomy classification with synthesized molecule-focused baselines to demonstrate that current models are inadequate for understanding natural synthesis. Furthermore, by diving into a fine-grained analysis at both the gene and microbial levels, NaFM demonstrates the ability to capture evolutionary information.

Factors like multipath interference and obstructions introduce different levels of complexity that affect the accuracy of the localization. Although generalized models offer broad applicability, they often struggle to capture the nuances of specific environments, leading to suboptimal performance in real-world deployments. In contrast, specialized models can be tailored to particular conditions, enabling more precise localization by effectively handling domain-specific variations, which also results in reduced execution time and smaller model size. However, deploying multiple specialized models requires an efficient mechanism to select the most appropriate one for a given scenario. In this work, we develop an adaptive localization framework that combines shallow attention-based models with a router/switching mechanism based on a single-layer perceptron. This enables seamless transitions between specialized localization models optimized for different conditions, balancing accuracy and computational complexity. We design three low-complex models tailored for distinct scenarios, and a router that dynamically selects the most suitable model based on real-time input characteristics. The proposed framework is validated using real-world vehicle localization data collected from a massive MIMO base station and compared to more general models."

Nevertheless, real-time, open-vocabulary semantic understanding of large-scale unknown environments is still an open problem. In this paper we present FindAnything, an open-world mapping and exploration framework that incorporates vision-language information into dense volumetric submaps. Thanks to the use of vision-language features, FindAnything bridges the gap between pure geometric and open-vocabulary semantic information for a higher level of understanding while allowing to explore any environment without the help of any external source of ground-truth pose information. We represent the environment as a series of volumetric occupancy submaps, resulting in a robust and accurate map representation that deforms upon pose updates when the underlying SLAM system corrects its drift, allowing for a locally consistent representation between submaps. Pixel-wise vision-language features are aggregated from efficient SAM (eSAM)-generated segments, which are in turn integrated into object-centric volumetric submaps, providing a mapping from open-vocabulary queries to 3D geometry that is scalable also in terms of memory usage. The open-vocabulary map representation of FindAnything achieves state-of-the-art semantic accuracy in closed-set evaluations on the Replica dataset. This level of scene understanding allows a robot to explore environments based on objects or areas of interest selected via natural language queries. Our system is the first of its kind to be deployed on resource-constrained devices, such as MAVs, leveraging vision-language information for real-world robotic tasks."

Such approaches fail to account for the diverse and complex learning patterns arising from individual differences and varying learning stages. To address this limitation, we propose RouterKT, a novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture designed to capture heterogeneous learning patterns by enabling experts to specialize in different patterns without any handcrafted learning pattern bias such as forgetting decay. Specifically, RouterKT introduces a \\textbf{person-wise routing mechanism} to effectively model individual-specific learning behaviors and employs \\textbf{multi-heads as experts} to enhance the modeling of complex and diverse patterns. Comprehensive experiments on ten benchmark datasets demonstrate that RouterKT exhibits significant flexibility and improves the performance of various KT backbone models, with a maximum average AUC improvement of 3.29\\% across different backbones and datasets, outperforming other state-of-the-art models. Moreover, RouterKT demonstrates consistently superior inference efficiency compared to existing approaches based on handcrafted learning pattern bias, highlighting its usability for real-world educational applications.

In lifted inference, a representative of indistinguishable objects is used for computations. To obtain a relational (i.e., lifted) representation, the Advanced Colour Passing (ACP) algorithm is the state of the art. The ACP algorithm, however, requires underlying distributions, encoded as potential-based factorisations, to exactly match to identify and exploit indistinguishabilities. Hence, ACP is unsuitable for practical applications where potentials learned from data inevitably deviate even if associated objects are indistinguishable. To mitigate this problem, we introduce the $\\varepsilon$-Advanced Colour Passing ($\\varepsilon$-ACP) algorithm, which allows for a deviation of potentials depending on a hyperparameter $\\varepsilon$. $\\varepsilon$-ACP efficiently uncovers and exploits indistinguishabilities that are not exact. We prove that the approximation error induced by $\\varepsilon$-ACP is strictly bounded and our experiments show that the approximation error is close to zero in practice."

However, relying exclusively on RGB images may neglect important depth information, which plays a critical role in understanding the spatial and structural context of a scene. Just as human vision leverages stereo cues to perceive depth, incorporating depth maps into the inpainting process can enhance the model's ability to reconstruct images with greater accuracy and contextual awareness. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that incorporates both RGB and depth images for enhanced image inpainting. Our models employ a dual encoder architecture, where one encoder processes the RGB image and the other handles the depth image. The encoded features from both encoders are then fused in the decoder using an attention mechanism, effectively integrating the RGB and depth representations. We use two different masking strategies, line and square, to test the robustness of the model under different types of occlusions. To further analyze the effectiveness of our approach, we use Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) visualizations to examine the regions of interest the model focuses on during inpainting. We show that incorporating depth information alongside the RGB image significantly improves the reconstruction quality. Through both qualitative and quantitative comparisons, we demonstrate that the depth-integrated model outperforms the baseline, with attention mechanisms further enhancing inpainting performance, as evidenced by multiple evaluation metrics and visualization."

We use a finitely repeated public goods game in which LLM agents choose either cooperative or egoistic spending strategies. We prime agents with stories highlighting teamwork to different degrees and test how this influences negotiation outcomes. Our experiments explore four questions:(1) How do narratives influence negotiation behavior? (2) What differs when agents share the same story versus different ones? (3) What happens when the agent numbers grow? (4) Are agents resilient against self-serving negotiators? We find that story-based priming significantly affects negotiation strategies and success rates. Common stories improve collaboration, benefiting each agent. By contrast, priming agents with different stories reverses this effect, and those agents primed toward self-interest prevail.

The extracted meshes are guaranteed to be watertight, two-manifold and intersection-free. The flexibility of TetWeave enables a resampling strategy that places new points where reconstruction error is high and allows to encourage mesh fairness without compromising on reconstruction error. This leads to high-quality, adaptive meshes that require minimal memory usage and few parameters to optimize. Consequently, TetWeave exhibits near-linear memory scaling relative to the vertex count of the output mesh - a substantial improvement over predefined grids.

Leveraging neural text-to-speech synthesis with FastSpeech 2 and VALL-E for expressive narration and character-specific voices, the framework employs advanced language models to automatically interpret textual narratives and generate realistic spatial audio effects. These sound effects are dynamically synchronized with the storyline through sophisticated temporal integration methods, including Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Diffusion-based generative models combined with higher-order ambisonics (HOA) and scattering delay networks (SDN) enable highly realistic 3D soundscapes, substantially enhancing listener immersion and narrative realism.

        "summary": "arXiv:2505.05055v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: MIDI performances are generally expedient in performance research and music information retrieval, and even more so if they can be connected to a score. This connection is usually established by means of alignment, linking either notes or time points between the score and the performance. The first obstacle when trying to establish such an alignment is that a performance realizes one (out of many) structural versions of the score that can plausibly result from instructions such as repeats, variations, and navigation markers like 'dal segno/da capo al coda'. A score needs to be unfolded, that is, its repeats and navigation markers need to be explicitly written out to create a single timeline without jumps matching the performance, before alignment algorithms can be applied. In the curation of large performance corpora this process is carried out manually, as no tools are available to infer the repeat structure of the performance. To ease this process, we develop a method to automatically infer the repeat structure of a MIDI performance, given a symbolically encoded score including repeat and navigation markers. The intuition guiding our design is: 1) local alignment of every contiguous section of the score with a section of a performance containing the same material should receive high alignment gain, whereas local alignment with any other performance section should accrue a low or zero gain. And 2) stitching local alignments together according to a valid structural version of the score should result in an approximate full alignment and correspondingly high global accumulated gain if the structural version corresponds to the performance, and low gain for all other, ill-fitting structural versions."

We propose ReverbMiipher, an SR model extending parametric resynthesis framework, designed to denoise speech while preserving and enabling control over reverberation. ReverbMiipher incorporates a dedicated ReverbEncoder to extract a reverb feature vector from noisy input. This feature conditions a vocoder to reconstruct the speech signal, removing noise while retaining the original reverberation characteristics. A stochastic zero-vector replacement strategy during training ensures the feature specifically encodes reverberation, disentangling it from other speech attributes. This learned representation facilitates reverberation control via techniques such as interpolation between features, replacement with features from other utterances, or sampling from a latent space. Objective and subjective evaluations confirm ReverbMiipher effectively preserves reverberation, removes other artifacts, and outperforms the conventional two-stage SR and convolving simulated room impulse response approach. We further demonstrate its ability to generate novel reverberation effects through feature manipulation."

Most existing methods approach this problem exclusively in the audio domain, typically using online time warping (OLTW) techniques on incoming audio and an audio representation of the score. Audio OLTW techniques have seen incremental improvements both in features and model heuristics which reached a performance plateau in the past ten years. We argue that converting and representing the performance in the symbolic domain -- thereby transforming music tracking into a symbolic task -- can be a more effective approach, even when the domain transformation is imperfect. Our music tracking system combines two real-time components: one handling audio-to-note transcription and the other a novel symbol-level tracker between transcribed input and score. We compare the performance of this mixed audio-symbolic approach with its equivalent audio-only counterpart, and demonstrate that our method outperforms the latter in terms of both precision, i.e., absolute tracking error, and robustness, i.e., tracking success."

For each mixture, LExt concatenates an enrollment utterance of the target speaker to the mixture signal at the waveform level, and trains deep neural networks (DNN) to extract the target speech based on the concatenated mixture signal. The rationale is that, this way, an artificial speech onset is created for the target speaker and it could prompt the DNN (a) which speaker is the target to extract; and (b) spectral-temporal patterns of the target speaker that could help extraction.

To better capture these variations, we propose to approach this task as a regression problem. Apart from predicting only the pitch for a particular region in the audio, we also predict its uncertainty to enhance the trustworthiness of the model. To perform regression-based melody estimation, we propose three different methods that use histogram representation to model the pitch values. Such a representation requires the support range of the histogram to be continuous. The first two methods address the abrupt discontinuity between unvoiced and voiced frequency ranges by mapping them to a continuous range. The third method reformulates melody estimation as a fully Bayesian task, modeling voicing detection as a classification problem, and voiced pitch estimation as a regression problem. Additionally, we introduce a novel method to estimate the uncertainty from the histogram representation that correlates well with the deviation of the mean of the predicted distribution from the ground truth. Experimental results demonstrate that reformulating melody estimation as a regression problem significantly improves the performance over classification-based approaches. Comparing the proposed methods with a state-of-the-art regression model, it is observed that the Bayesian method performs the best at estimating both the melody and its associated uncertainty."

        "summary": "arXiv:2505.05159v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Current speech generation research can be categorized into two primary classes: non-autoregressive and autoregressive. The fundamental distinction between these approaches lies in the duration prediction strategy employed for predictable-length sequences. The NAR methods ensure stability in speech generation by explicitly and independently modeling the duration of each phonetic unit. Conversely, AR methods employ an autoregressive paradigm to predict the compressed speech token by implicitly modeling duration with Markov properties. Although this approach improves prosody, it does not provide the structural guarantees necessary for stability. To simultaneously address the issues of stability and naturalness in speech generation, we propose FlexSpeech, a stable, controllable, and expressive TTS model. The motivation behind FlexSpeech is to incorporate Markov dependencies and preference optimization directly on the duration predictor to boost its naturalness while maintaining explicit modeling of the phonetic units to ensure stability. Specifically, we decompose the speech generation task into two components: an AR duration predictor and a NAR acoustic model. The acoustic model is trained on a substantial amount of data to learn to render audio more stably, given reference audio prosody and phone durations. The duration predictor is optimized in a lightweight manner for different stylistic variations, thereby enabling rapid style transfer while maintaining a decoupled relationship with the specified speaker timbre. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves SOTA stability and naturalness in zero-shot TTS. More importantly, when transferring to a specific stylistic domain, we can accomplish lightweight optimization of the duration module solely with about 100 data samples, without the need to adjust the acoustic model, thereby enabling rapid and stable style transfer."

Our method employs a Schroedinger bridge to transform the noisy speech distribution into the clean speech distribution. To stabilize and improve training, we employ time-dependent scalings of the inputs and outputs of the network, known as preconditioning. We consider two skip connection configurations, which either include or omit the current process state in the denoiser's output, enabling the network to predict either environmental noise or clean speech. Each approach leads to improved performance on different speech enhancement metrics. To maintain stable magnitude levels and balance during training, we use a magnitude-preserving network architecture that normalizes all activations and network weights to unit length. Additionally, we propose learning the contribution of the noisy input within each network block for effective input conditioning. After training, we apply a method to approximate different exponential moving average (EMA) profiles and investigate their effects on the speech enhancement performance. In contrast to image generation tasks, where longer EMA lengths often enhance mode coverage, we observe that shorter EMA lengths consistently lead to better performance on standard speech enhancement metrics.

While traditional sound event detection models can precisely localize events, they are limited to pre-defined categories, making them ineffective for real-world scenarios with out-of-distribution events. In this work, we introduce FLAM, an open-vocabulary contrastive audio-language model capable of localizing specific sound events. FLAM employs a memory-efficient and calibrated frame-wise objective with logit adjustment to address spurious correlations, such as event dependencies and label imbalances during training. To enable frame-wise supervision, we leverage a large-scale dataset with diverse audio events, LLM-generated captions and simulation.

Nevertheless, most existing studies primarily focus on the gesture generation of speakers, overlooking the vital role of listeners in the interaction process and failing to fully explore the dynamic interaction between them. This paper innovatively proposes an Inter-Diffusion Generation Model of Speakers and Listeners for Effective Communication. For the first time, we integrate the full-body gestures of listeners into the generation framework. By devising a novel inter-diffusion mechanism, this model can accurately capture the complex interaction patterns between speakers and listeners during communication. In the model construction process, based on the advanced diffusion model architecture, we innovatively introduce interaction conditions and the GAN model to increase the denoising step size. As a result, when generating gesture sequences, the model can not only dynamically generate based on the speaker's speech information but also respond in realtime to the listener's feedback, enabling synergistic interaction between the two. Abundant experimental results demonstrate that compared with the current state-of-the-art gesture generation methods, the model we proposed has achieved remarkable improvements in the naturalness, coherence, and speech-gesture synchronization of the generated gestures. In the subjective evaluation experiments, users highly praised the generated interaction scenarios, believing that they are closer to real life human communication situations. Objective index evaluations also show that our model outperforms the baseline methods in multiple key indicators, providing more powerful support for effective communication."

This commentary introduces a conceptual framework--and a demonstration of how it can be implemented--leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to advance cross-language intelligibility assessment of dysarthric speech. Method: We propose a two-tiered conceptual framework consisting of a universal speech model that encodes dysarthric speech into acoustic-phonetic representations, followed by a language-specific intelligibility assessment model that interprets these representations within the phonological or prosodic structures of the target language. We further identify barriers to cross-language intelligibility assessment of dysarthric speech, including data scarcity, annotation complexity, and limited linguistic insights into dysarthric speech, and outline potential AI-driven solutions to overcome these challenges. Conclusion: Advancing cross-language intelligibility assessment of dysarthric speech necessitates models that are both efficient and scalable, yet constrained by linguistic rules to ensure accurate and language-sensitive assessment. Recent advances in AI provide the foundational tools to support this integration, shaping future directions toward generalizable and linguistically informed assessment frameworks."
