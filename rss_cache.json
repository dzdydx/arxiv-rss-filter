        "summary": "arXiv:2507.07108v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL) aims to link ambiguous mentions within multimodal contexts to associated entities in a multimodal knowledge base. Existing approaches to MEL introduce multimodal interaction and fusion mechanisms to bridge the modality gap and enable multi-grained semantic matching. However, they do not address two important problems: (i) mention ambiguity, i.e., the lack of semantic content caused by the brevity and omission of key information in the mention's textual context; (ii) dynamic selection of modal content, i.e., to dynamically distinguish the importance of different parts of modal information. To mitigate these issues, we propose a Multi-level Mixture of Experts (MMoE) model for MEL. MMoE has four components: (i) the description-aware mention enhancement module leverages large language models to identify the WikiData descriptions that best match a mention, considering the mention's textual context; (ii) the multimodal feature extraction module adopts multimodal feature encoders to obtain textual and visual embeddings for both mentions and entities; (iii)-(iv) the intra-level mixture of experts and inter-level mixture of experts modules apply a switch mixture of experts mechanism to dynamically and adaptively select features from relevant regions of information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the outstanding performance of MMoE compared to the state-of-the-art. MMoE's code is available at: https://github.com/zhiweihu1103/MEL-MMoE."

UDA methods are particularly impactful for semantic segmentation, where annotations are more difficult to collect than in image classification. Despite recent advances in large-scale vision-language representation learning, UDA methods for segmentation have not taken advantage of the domain-agnostic properties of text. To address this, we present a novel Covariance-based Pixel-Text loss, CoPT, that uses domain-agnostic text embeddings to learn domain-invariant features in an image segmentation encoder. The text embeddings are generated through our LLM Domain Template process, where an LLM is used to generate source and target domain descriptions that are fed to a frozen CLIP model and combined. In experiments on four benchmarks we show that a model trained using CoPT achieves the new state of the art performance on UDA for segmentation.

This paper explores an alternative, constructive approach to model development, built upon the foundation of non-trainable, deterministic input embeddings. In prior [1], we established that high-level semantic reasoning can emerge in Transformers using frozen embeddings derived from the visual structure of Unicode glyphs. Here, we demonstrate that this fixed representational substrate acts as a universal \"docking port,\" enabling two powerful and efficient scaling paradigms: seamless modular composition and progressive layer-wise growth.\n  First, we show that specialist models trained on disparate datasets (e.g., Russian and Chinese text) can be merged into a single, more capable Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model, post-training, with zero architectural modification. This is achieved by simply averaging their output logits. The resulting MoE model exhibits immediate performance improvements on reasoning benchmarks like MMLU, surpassing its constituent experts without catastrophic forgetting. Second, we introduce a layer-wise constructive training methodology, where a deep Transformer is \"grown\" by progressively stacking and training one layer at a time. This method demonstrates stable convergence and a clear correlation between model depth and the emergence of complex reasoning abilities, such as those required for SQuAD.\n  Our findings suggest a paradigm shift from monolithic optimization towards a more biological or constructive model of AI development, where complexity is built incrementally and modules can be composed freely. This opens new avenues for resource-efficient scaling, continual learning, and a more democratized ecosystem for building powerful AI systems. We release all code and models to facilitate further research."

Recent methods for CIR leverage large pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) and achieve good performance on general-domain concepts like color and texture. However, they still struggle with application domains like fashion, because the rich and diverse vocabulary used in fashion requires specific fine-grained vision and language understanding. An additional difficulty is the lack of large-scale fashion datasets with detailed and relevant annotations, due to the expensive cost of manual annotation by specialists. To address these challenges, we introduce FACap, a large-scale, automatically constructed fashion-domain CIR dataset. It leverages web-sourced fashion images and a two-stage annotation pipeline powered by a VLM and a large language model (LLM) to generate accurate and detailed modification texts. Then, we propose a new CIR model FashionBLIP-2, which fine-tunes the general-domain BLIP-2 model on FACap with lightweight adapters and multi-head query-candidate matching to better account for fine-grained fashion-specific information. FashionBLIP-2 is evaluated with and without additional fine-tuning on the Fashion IQ benchmark and the enhanced evaluation dataset enhFashionIQ, leveraging our pipeline to obtain higher-quality annotations. Experimental results show that the combination of FashionBLIP-2 and pretraining with FACap significantly improves the model's performance in fashion CIR especially for retrieval with fine-grained modification texts, demonstrating the value of our dataset and approach in a highly demanding environment such as e-commerce websites.

While MU is orders of magnitude less costly than retraining a diffusion model without the undesired information, it can be challenging and labor-intensive to prove that the information has been fully removed from the model. Moreover, MU can damage diffusion model performance on surrounding concepts that one would like to retain, making it unclear if the diffusion model is still fit for deployment. We introduce autoeval-dmun, an automated tool which leverages (vision-) language models to thoroughly assess unlearning in diffusion models. Given a target concept, autoeval-dmun extracts structured, relevant world knowledge from the language model to identify nearby concepts which are likely damaged by unlearning and to circumvent unlearning with adversarial prompts. We use our automated tool to evaluate popular diffusion model unlearning methods, revealing that language models (1) impose semantic orderings of nearby concepts which correlate well with unlearning damage and (2) effectively circumvent unlearning with synthetic adversarial prompts."

Existing methods to inject such structural context either incur high computational cost or rely on simplistic heuristics (e.g., common neighbor counts) that fail to model multi-hop dependencies. We introduce SP4LP (Shortest Path for Link Prediction), a novel framework that combines GNN-based node encodings with sequence modeling over shortest paths. Specifically, SP4LP first applies a GNN to compute representations for all nodes, then extracts the shortest path between each candidate node pair and processes the resulting sequence of node embeddings using a sequence model. This design enables SP4LP to capture expressive multi-hop relational patterns with computational efficiency. Empirically, SP4LP achieves state-of-the-art performance across link prediction benchmarks. Theoretically, we prove that SP4LP is strictly more expressive than standard message-passing GNNs and several state-of-the-art structural features methods, establishing it as a general and principled approach for link prediction in graphs."

However, their generative capability has also raised significant ethical, legal, and societal concerns, including the potential to produce harmful, misleading, or copyright-infringing content. To mitigate these concerns, machine unlearning (MU) emerges as a promising solution by selectively removing undesirable concepts from pretrained models. Nevertheless, the robustness and effectiveness of existing unlearning techniques remain largely unexplored, particularly in the presence of multi-modal adversarial inputs.\n  To bridge this gap, we propose Recall, a novel adversarial framework explicitly designed to compromise the robustness of unlearned IGMs. Unlike existing approaches that predominantly rely on adversarial text prompts, Recall exploits the intrinsic multi-modal conditioning capabilities of diffusion models by efficiently optimizing adversarial image prompts with guidance from a single semantically relevant reference image. Extensive experiments across ten state-of-the-art unlearning methods and diverse tasks show that Recall consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of adversarial effectiveness, computational efficiency, and semantic fidelity with the original textual prompt. These findings reveal critical vulnerabilities in current unlearning mechanisms and underscore the need for more robust solutions to ensure the safety and reliability of generative models.

Typically, LoRA serves as the foundational building block of such parameter-efficient modular architectures, leveraging low-rank weight structures to reduce the number of trainable parameters. In this paper, we study the properties of sparse adapters, which train only a subset of weights in the base neural network, as potential building blocks of modular architectures. First, we propose a simple method for training highly effective sparse adapters, which is conceptually simpler than existing methods in the literature and surprisingly outperforms both LoRA and full fine-tuning in our setting. Next, we investigate the merging properties of these sparse adapters by merging adapters for up to 20 natural language processing tasks, thus scaling beyond what is usually studied in the literature. Our findings demonstrate that sparse adapters yield superior in-distribution performance post-merging compared to LoRA or full model merging. Achieving strong held-out performance remains a challenge for all methods considered."

Due to the lack of explicit information and clear guidance in general graph, identifying and integrating such structural commonsense in GCL poses a significant challenge. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework called Structural Commonsense Unveiling in Graph Contrastive Learning (Str-GCL). Str-GCL leverages first-order logic rules to represent structural commonsense and explicitly integrates them into the GCL framework. It introduces topological and attribute-based rules without altering the original graph and employs a representation alignment mechanism to guide the encoder in effectively capturing this commonsense. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to directly incorporate structural commonsense into GCL. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Str-GCL outperforms existing GCL methods, providing a new perspective on leveraging structural commonsense in graph representation learning."

In this work, we apply scientific machine learning to malware modeling by evaluating three approaches: classical Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), Universal Differential Equations (UDEs), and Neural ODEs. Using data from the Code Red worm outbreak, we show that the UDE approach substantially reduces prediction error compared to both traditional and neural baselines by 44%, while preserving interpretability. We introduce a symbolic recovery method that transforms the learned neural feedback into explicit mathematical expressions, revealing suppression mechanisms such as network saturation, security response, and malware variant evolution. Our results demonstrate that hybrid physics-informed models can outperform both purely analytical and purely neural approaches, offering improved predictive accuracy and deeper insight into the dynamics of malware spread.

We propose Convolutional Code Quantization (CCQ), an inference-optimized quantization approach compressing LLMs to 2.0-2.75 bits with minimal accuracy loss. Departing from error-prone scalar quantization or slow vector quantization, CCQ integrates a hardware-aware bit-shift encoding and decoding solution with Convolutional Code, Hybrid Encoding, and Code Cluster, jointly overcoming accuracy-speed bottlenecks. We construct a lookup-free encoding space, enabling a linear mapping between the codebook and weight vectors, thereby optimizing inference performance. Meanwhile, by drawing on the concept of data mapping from vector quantization, we minimize the performance degradation of the model under extremely low-bit conditions. Experiments demonstrate that CCQ achieves outstanding performance on LLMs across various benchmarks. We compress DeepSeek-V3 (671B total parameters) to 184GB and ERNIE-4.5-300B-A47B to 89GB, enabling single-GPU deployment of ERNIE 4.5 and eliminating inter-card communication.

We formally define the modality conflict and construct a dataset named Multimodal Modality Conflict (MMMC) to simulate this phenomenon in vision-language tasks. Three methods based on prompt engineering, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning are proposed to alleviate the hallucination caused by modality conflict. Extensive experiments are conducted on the MMMC dataset to analyze the merits and demerits of these methods.

Most existing deep learning-based polyp segmentation methods adopt an Encoder-Decoder architecture, and some utilize multi-task frameworks that incorporate auxiliary tasks such as classification to enhance segmentation performance. However, these approaches often require additional labeled data and rely on task similarity, which can limit their generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose CL-Polyp, a contrastive learning-enhanced polyp segmentation network. Our method leverages contrastive learning to improve the encoder's ability to extract discriminative features by contrasting positive and negative sample pairs derived from polyp images. This self-supervised strategy enhances visual representation without requiring additional annotations. In addition, we introduce two lightweight and effective modules: the Modified Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (MASPP) module for better multi-scale feature fusion, and the Channel Concatenate and Element Add (CA) module to fuse low-level and upsampled features for improved boundary reconstruction. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets-Kvasir-SEG, CVC-ClinicDB, CVC-ColonDB, CVC-300, and ETIS-demonstrate that CL-Polyp consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, it improves the IoU metric by 0.011 and 0.020 on the Kvasir-SEG and CVC-ClinicDB datasets, respectively, validating its effectiveness in clinical polyp segmentation tasks."

Our model bypasses direct EEG-to-image generation by aligning EEG signals with multilevel semantic captions -- ranging from object-level to abstract themes -- generated by a large language model. A transformer-based EEG encoder maps brain activity to these captions through contrastive learning. During inference, caption embeddings retrieved via projection heads condition a pretrained latent diffusion model for image generation. This text-mediated framework yields state-of-the-art visual decoding on the EEGCVPR dataset, with interpretable alignment to known neurocognitive pathways. Dominant EEG-caption associations reflected the importance of different semantic levels extracted from perceived images.

Prior work has found that these biases vary across models and can be amplified by instruction tuning. However, it remains unclear if these differences in biases stem from pretraining, finetuning, or even random noise due to training stochasticity. We propose a two-step causal experimental approach to disentangle these factors. First, we finetune models multiple times using different random seeds to study how training randomness affects over $30$ cognitive biases. Second, we introduce \\emph{cross-tuning} -- swapping instruction datasets between models to isolate bias sources. This swap uses datasets that led to different bias patterns, directly testing whether biases are dataset-dependent. Our findings reveal that while training randomness introduces some variability, biases are mainly shaped by pretraining: models with the same pretrained backbone exhibit more similar bias patterns than those sharing only finetuning data. These insights suggest that understanding biases in finetuned models requires considering their pretraining origins beyond finetuning effects. This perspective can guide future efforts to develop principled strategies for evaluating and mitigating bias in LLMs."

To address these challenges and fully unlock the untapped potential of flow matching, we propose Conditional Guided Flow Matching (CGFM). CGFM extends flow matching by incorporating the outputs of an auxiliary model, enabling a previously unattainable capability in the field: learning from the errors of the auxiliary model. For time series forecasting tasks, it integrates historical data as conditions and guidance, constructs two-sided conditional probability paths, and uses a general affine path to expand the space of probability paths, ultimately leading to improved predictions.

On the other hand, Reinforcement Learning (RL) focuses on maximizing the cumulative reward obtained via agent's interaction with the environment. RL agents do not have any prior knowledge about the world, and they either learn from scratch an end-to-end mapping between the observation and action spaces or, in more recent works, are paired with monolithic and computationally expensive Foundational Models. How to effectively combine and leverage the hidden information of different pre-trained models simultaneously in RL is still an open and understudied question. In this work, we propose Weight Sharing Attention (WSA), a new architecture to combine embeddings of multiple pre-trained models to shape an enriched state representation, balancing the tradeoff between efficiency and performance. We run an extensive comparison between several combination modes showing that WSA obtains comparable performance on multiple Atari games compared to end-to-end models.

However, even for the most capable models, there are still frequent failure cases that raise doubts about their compositionality. Here, we seek to understand what it takes for a standard neural network to generalize over tasks that share compositional structure. We find that simply scaling data and model size leads to compositional generalization. We show that this holds across different task encodings as long as the training distribution sufficiently covers the task space. In line with this finding, we prove that standard multilayer perceptrons can approximate a general class of compositional task families to arbitrary precision using only a linear number of neurons with respect to the number of task modules. Finally, we uncover that if networks successfully compositionally generalize, the constituents of a task can be linearly decoded from their hidden activations. We show that this metric correlates with failures of text-to-image generation models to compose known concepts."

This type of bias has been conceptually and empirically explored and is widely recognized as a pressing issue across critical domains. However, effective methodologies for addressing it remain scarce. In this work, we propose Decoupled Confident Learning (DeCoLe), a principled machine learning based framework specifically designed to detect mislabeled instances in datasets affected by label bias, enabling bias aware mislabelling detection and facilitating data quality improvement. We theoretically justify the effectiveness of DeCoLe and evaluate its performance in the impactful context of hate speech detection, a domain where label bias is a well documented challenge. Empirical results demonstrate that DeCoLe excels at bias aware mislabeling detection, consistently outperforming alternative approaches for label error detection. Our work identifies and addresses the challenge of bias aware mislabeling detection and offers guidance on how DeCoLe can be integrated into organizational data management practices as a powerful tool to enhance data reliability."

Building on this idea, deep learning methods such as VAMPnet and DPNet have been proposed to learn the leading singular subspaces of the Koopman operator. However, these methods require backpropagation through potentially numerically unstable operations on empirical second moment matrices, such as singular value decomposition and matrix inversion, during objective computation, which can introduce biased gradient estimates and hinder scalability to large systems. In this work, we propose a scalable and conceptually simple method for learning the top-k singular functions of the Koopman operator for stochastic dynamical systems based on the idea of low-rank approximation. Our approach eliminates the need for unstable linear algebraic operations and integrates easily into modern deep learning pipelines. Empirical results demonstrate that the learned singular subspaces are both reliable and effective for downstream tasks such as eigen-analysis and multi-step prediction."

In contrast, we explore the use of color - specifically foreground and background colors - as a lightweight, annotation-free proxy for mitigating appearance bias in ReID models. We propose Colors See, Colors Ignore (CSCI), an RGB-only method that leverages color information directly from raw images or video frames. CSCI efficiently captures color-related appearance bias ('Color See') while disentangling it from identity-relevant ReID features ('Color Ignore'). To achieve this, we introduce S2A self-attention, a novel self-attention to prevent information leak between color and identity cues within the feature space. Our analysis shows a strong correspondence between learned color embeddings and clothing attributes, validating color as an effective proxy when explicit clothing labels are unavailable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CSCI on both image and video ReID with extensive experiments on four CC-ReID datasets.

Currently, phase field modeling (PFM) of fracture is one such approach that offers a convenient variational formulation to model crack nucleation, branching and propagation. To date, machine learning techniques have shown promise in approximating PFM simulations. However, most studies rely on overly simple benchmarks that do not reflect the true complexity of the fracture processes where PFM excels as a method.

Unlike traditional inference setups, these distributed pipelines span the model computation across heterogeneous nodes and communication layers, thereby exposing a broader attack surface to potential adversaries. Building on these motivations, this work explores a previously overlooked vulnerability: even when both the edge and cloud components of the model are inaccessible (i.e., black-box), an adversary who intercepts the intermediate features transmitted between them can still pose a serious threat. We demonstrate that, under these mild and realistic assumptions, an attacker can craft highly transferable proxy models, making the entire deep learning system significantly more vulnerable to evasion attacks. In particular, the intercepted features can be effectively analyzed and leveraged to distill surrogate models capable of crafting highly transferable adversarial examples against the target model. To this end, we propose an exploitation strategy specifically designed for distributed settings, which involves reconstructing the original tensor shape from vectorized transmitted features using simple statistical analysis, and adapting surrogate architectures accordingly to enable effective feature distillation. A comprehensive and systematic experimental evaluation has been conducted to demonstrate that surrogate models trained with the proposed strategy, i.e., leveraging intermediate features, tremendously improve the transferability of adversarial attacks. These findings underscore the urgent need to account for intermediate feature leakage in the design of secure distributed deep learning systems."

Wrist-worn inertial measurement units (IMUs) have been widely used for this task with promising results. More recently, contactless radar sensors have also shown potential. This study explores whether combining wearable and contactless sensing modalities through multimodal learning can further improve detection performance. We also address a major challenge in multimodal learning: reduced robustness when one modality is missing. To this end, we propose a robust multimodal temporal convolutional network with cross-modal attention (MM-TCN-CMA), designed to integrate IMU and radar data, enhance gesture detection, and maintain performance under missing modality conditions. A new dataset comprising 52 meal sessions (3,050 eating gestures and 797 drinking gestures) from 52 participants is developed and made publicly available. Experimental results show that the proposed framework improves the segmental F1-score by 4.3% and 5.2% over unimodal Radar and IMU models, respectively. Under missing modality scenarios, the framework still achieves gains of 1.3% and 2.4% for missing radar and missing IMU inputs. This is the first study to demonstrate a robust multimodal learning framework that effectively fuses IMU and radar data for food intake gesture detection."

To overcome this, we propose a multimodal language-guided framework that replaces reliance on additional visual data with structured textual supervision. At its core, we introduce \\textbf{DisenQ} (\\textbf{Disen}tangling \\textbf{Q}-Former), a unified querying transformer that disentangles biometrics, motion, and non-biometrics features by leveraging structured language guidance. This ensures identity cues remain independent of appearance and motion variations, preventing misidentifications.

We propose a framework for modelling treatment effect trajectories as smooth surfaces over dose and time, enabling the extraction of clinically actionable insights such as onset time, peak effect, and duration of benefit. To ensure interpretability, robustness, and verifiability -- key requirements in high-stakes domains -- we adapt SemanticODE, a recent framework for interpretable trajectory modelling, to the causal setting where treatment effects are never directly observed. Our approach decouples the estimation of trajectory shape from the specification of clinically relevant properties (e.g., maxima, inflection points), supporting domain-informed priors, post-hoc editing, and transparent analysis. We show that our method yields accurate, interpretable, and editable models of treatment dynamics, facilitating both rigorous causal analysis and practical decision-making."

For a complex model such as a random forest, such importances are not innate -- as they are, e.g., with linear regression. Efficient methods have been created to provide such capabilities, with one of the most popular among them being permutation feature importance due to its efficiency, model-agnostic nature, and perceived intuitiveness. However, permutation feature importance has been shown to be misleading in the presence of dependent features as a result of the creation of unrealistic observations when permuting the dependent features. In this work, we develop TRIP (Test for Reliable Interpretation via Permutation), a test requiring minimal assumptions that is able to detect unreliable permutation feature importance scores that are the result of model extrapolation. To build on this, we demonstrate how the test can be complemented in order to allow its use in high dimensional settings. Through testing on simulated data and applications, our results show that the test can be used to reliably detect when permutation feature importance scores are unreliable."

AI agents deployed in classrooms for collaborative learning within small groups will need to contend with multiple concurrent conversations -- in this context, overlapping speech will be ubiquitous, and interruptions will need to be identified in other ways. In this work, we analyze interruption detection in single-conversation and multi-group dialogue settings. We then create a state-of-the-art method for interruption identification that is robust to overlapping speech, and thus could be deployed in classrooms. Further, our work highlights meaningful linguistic and prosodic information about how interruptions manifest in collaborative group interactions.

By optimising the objective function in the space of search distributions, NES algorithms naturally integrate prior knowledge during initialisation, making them effective in settings such as semi-supervised learning and user-prior belief frameworks. However, due to their reliance on random sampling and Monte Carlo estimates, NES algorithms can suffer from limited sample efficiency. In this paper, we introduce a novel class of algorithms, termed Probabilistic Natural Evolutionary Strategy Algorithms (ProbNES), which enhance the NES framework with Bayesian quadrature.

In this work, we propose a framework that addresses all these challenges using a Mixture of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and tools from Riemannian geometry. We specifically focus on estimating the ID of datasets by analyzing the numerical rank of the VAE decoder pullback metric. The estimated ID guides the construction of an atlas of local charts using a mixture of invertible VAEs, enabling accurate manifold parameterization and efficient inference. We how this approach enhances solutions to ill-posed inverse problems, particularly in biomedical imaging, by enforcing that reconstructions lie on the learned manifold.

This work studies the performance of frontier LLMs on a broad set of such \"easy\" reasoning problems. By extending previous work in the literature, we create a suite of procedurally generated simple reasoning tasks, including counting, first-order logic, proof trees, and travel planning, with changeable parameters (such as document length. or the number of variables in a math problem) that can arbitrarily increase the amount of computation required to produce the answer while preserving the fundamental difficulty. While previous work showed that traditional, non-thinking models can be made to fail on such problems, we demonstrate that even state-of-the-art thinking models consistently fail on such problems and for similar reasons (e.g. statistical shortcuts, errors in intermediate steps, and difficulties in processing long contexts). To further understand the behavior of the models, we introduce the unpuzzles dataset, a different \"easy\" benchmark consisting of trivialized versions of well-known math and logic puzzles. Interestingly, while modern LLMs excel at solving the original puzzles, they tend to fail on the trivialized versions, exhibiting several systematic failure patterns related to memorizing the originals. We show that this happens even if the models are otherwise able to solve problems with different descriptions but requiring the same logic. Our results highlight that out-of-distribution generalization is still problematic for frontier language models and the new generation of thinking models, even for simple reasoning tasks, and making tasks easier does not necessarily imply improved performance."

In our model, several base stations (BSs) with heterogeneous task-handling capabilities and multiple users with non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data jointly perform CFL training incorporating differential privacy (DP) techniques. Since each BS can process only a subset of the learning tasks and has limited wireless resource blocks (RBs) to allocate to users for federated learning (FL) model parameter transmission, it is necessary to jointly optimize RB allocation and user scheduling for CFL performance optimization. Meanwhile, our considered CFL method requires devices to use their limited data and FL model information to determine their task identities, which may introduce additional communication overhead. We formulate an optimization problem whose goal is to minimize the training loss of all learning tasks while considering device clustering, RB allocation, DP noise, and FL model transmission delay. To solve the problem, we propose a novel dynamic penalty function assisted value decomposed multi-agent reinforcement learning (DPVD-MARL) algorithm that enables distributed BSs to independently determine their connected users, RBs, and DP noise of the connected users but jointly minimize the training loss of all learning tasks across all BSs. Different from the existing MARL methods that assign a large penalty for invalid actions, we propose a novel penalty assignment scheme that assigns penalty depending on the number of devices that cannot meet communication constraints (e.g., delay), which can guide the MARL scheme to quickly find valid actions, thus improving the convergence speed. Simulation results show that the DPVD-MARL can improve the convergence rate by up to 20% and the ultimate accumulated rewards by 15% compared to independent Q-learning."

To prevent the eavesdroppers from collecting model and data information, a subset of devices can transmit deceptive signals. Therefore, it is necessary to determine the subset of devices used for deceptive signal transmission, the subset of model training devices, and the models assigned to each model training device. This problem is formulated as an optimization problem whose goal is to minimize the information leaked to eavesdroppers while meeting the model training energy consumption and delay constraints.

This work establishes a viable framework for adapting generalist LLMs into reliable, specialized tools for chemical research, while also delineating critical areas for future improvement."

A critical technical challenge in foundation VTO applications is the accurate synthesis of foundation-skin tone color blending while maintaining the scalability of the method across diverse product ranges.

This challenge is typically addressed by training with multiple contexts and/or by leveraging additional structure in the problem.

In this work, we consider contextual Markov decision processes (CMDPs) with transition and reward functions that exhibit regularity in context parameters.

We prove both analytically and empirically that the CEBE yields a first-order approximation to the Q-function trained across multiple contexts.

Current graph-based methods for disease classification detect patient-specific molecular fingerprints, but lack consistency and comprehension regarding cohort-wide features, which are an essential requirement for understanding pathogenic phenotypes across diverse atherosclerotic trajectories. Furthermore, understanding patient subtypes often considers clinical feature similarity in isolation, without integration of shared pathogenic interdependencies among patients. To address these challenges, we introduce ATHENA: Atherosclerosis Through Hierarchical Explainable Neural Network Analysis, which constructs a novel hierarchical network representation through integrated modality learning; subsequently, it optimizes learned patient-specific molecular fingerprints that reflect individual omics data, enforcing consistency with cohort-wide patterns. With a primary clinical dataset of 391 patients, we demonstrate that this heterogeneous alignment of clinical features with molecular interaction patterns has significantly boosted subclinical atherosclerosis classification performance across various baselines by up to 13% in area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) and 20% in F1 score. Taken together, ATHENA enables mechanistically-informed patient subtype discovery through explainable AI (XAI)-driven subnetwork clustering; this novel integration framework strengthens personalized intervention strategies, thereby improving the prediction of atherosclerotic disease progression and management of their clinical actionable outcomes."

This paper presents PacGDC, a label-efficient technique that enhances data diversity with minimal annotation effort for generalizable depth completion. PacGDC builds on novel insights into inherent ambiguities and consistencies in object shapes and positions during 2D-to-3D projection, allowing the synthesis of numerous pseudo geometries for the same visual scene. This process greatly broadens available geometries by manipulating scene scales of the corresponding depth maps. To leverage this property, we propose a new data synthesis pipeline that uses multiple depth foundation models as scale manipulators. These models robustly provide pseudo depth labels with varied scene scales, affecting both local objects and global layouts, while ensuring projection consistency that supports generalization. To further diversify geometries, we incorporate interpolation and relocation strategies, as well as unlabeled images, extending the data coverage beyond the individual use of foundation models. Extensive experiments show that PacGDC achieves remarkable generalizability across multiple benchmarks, excelling in diverse scene semantics/scales and depth sparsity/patterns under both zero-shot and few-shot settings.

However, RLHF remains vulnerable to reward hacking, where the policy exploits imperfections in the reward function rather than genuinely learning the intended behavior. Although significant efforts have been made to mitigate reward hacking, they predominantly focus on and evaluate in-distribution scenarios, where the training and testing data for the reward model share the same distribution. In this paper, we empirically show that state-of-the-art methods struggle in more challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. We further demonstrate that incorporating fine-grained multi-attribute scores helps address this challenge. However, the limited availability of high-quality data often leads to weak performance of multi-objective reward functions, which can negatively impact overall performance and become the bottleneck. To address this issue, we propose a unified reward modeling framework that jointly trains Bradley--Terry (BT) single-objective and multi-objective regression-based reward functions using a shared embedding space. We theoretically establish a connection between the BT loss and the regression objective and highlight their complementary benefits. Specifically, the regression task enhances the single-objective reward function's ability to mitigate reward hacking in challenging OOD settings, while BT-based training improves the scoring capability of the multi-objective reward function, enabling a 7B model to outperform a 70B baseline. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly improves both the robustness and the scoring performance of reward models."

However, these methods still lack self-adaptivity -- that is, the ability to automatically adjust particle configurations to local geometric features of each surface, which is essential for accurately representing complex anatomical variability. This paper introduces two mechanisms to increase surface adaptivity while maintaining consistent particle configurations: (1) a novel neighborhood correspondence loss to enable high adaptivity and (2) a geodesic correspondence algorithm that regularizes optimization to enforce geodesic neighborhood consistency. We evaluate the efficacy and scalability of our approach on challenging datasets, providing a detailed analysis of the adaptivity-correspondence trade-off and benchmarking against existing methods on surface representation accuracy and correspondence metrics."

IML-Spikeformer further integrates a Reparameterized Spiking Self-Attention (RepSSA) module with a Hierarchical Decay Mask (HDM), forming the HD-RepSSA module. This module enhances the precision of attention maps and enables modeling of multi-scale temporal dependencies in speech signals. Experiments demonstrate that IML-Spikeformer achieves word error rates of 6.0\\% on AiShell-1 and 3.4\\% on Librispeech-960, comparable to conventional ANN transformers while reducing theoretical inference energy consumption by 4.64$\\times$ and 4.32$\\times$ respectively. IML-Spikeformer marks an advance of scalable SNN architectures for large-scale speech processing in both task performance and energy efficiency."

Existing evaluation methods often lack semantic understanding, face challenges with high computational costs, and are constrained by the current progress of automated theorem proving. To address these issues, we propose GTED (Generalized Tree Edit Distance), a novel evaluation framework that first standardizes formal statements and converts them into operator trees, then determines the semantic similarity using the eponymous GTED metric. On the miniF2F and ProofNet benchmarks, GTED outperforms all baseline metrics by achieving the highest accuracy and Kappa scores, thus providing the community with a more faithful metric for automated evaluation.

However, these methods face the issue of a mismatch between the pre-trained model and downstream tasks, leading to suboptimal performance in certain application scenarios. Prompt learning methods have emerged as a new direction in heterogeneous graph tasks, as they allow flexible adaptation of task representations to address target inconsistency. Building on this idea, this paper proposes a novel multi-task prompt framework for the heterogeneous graph domain, named HGMP. First, to bridge the gap between the pre-trained model and downstream tasks, we reformulate all downstream tasks into a unified graph-level task format. Next, we address the limitations of existing graph prompt learning methods, which struggle to integrate contrastive pre-training strategies in the heterogeneous graph domain. We design a graph-level contrastive pre-training strategy to better leverage heterogeneous information and enhance performance in multi-task scenarios. Finally, we introduce heterogeneous feature prompts, which enhance model performance by refining the representation of input graph features. Experimental results on public datasets show that our proposed method adapts well to various tasks and significantly outperforms baseline methods."

In this context, we propose a novel efficient prompt-based multimodal interaction strategy, namely Efficient Prompt Interaction for text-image Classification (EPIC).

Most of these methods focus on imitating specific expert behaviors or promoting chosen reasoning thoughts and actions over rejected ones. However, without reasoning and comparing over alternatives actions, LLM agents finetuned with these methods may over-commit towards seemingly plausible but suboptimal actions due to limited action space exploration. To address this, in this paper we propose Self-taught ActioN Deliberation (SAND) framework, enabling LLM agents to explicitly deliberate over candidate actions before committing to one. To tackle the challenges of when and what to deliberate given large action space and step-level action evaluation, we incorporate self-consistency action sampling and execution-guided action critique to help synthesize step-wise action deliberation thoughts using the base model of the LLM agent. In an iterative manner, the deliberation trajectories are then used to finetune the LLM agent itself. Evaluating on two representative interactive agent tasks, SAND achieves an average 20% improvement over initial supervised finetuning and also outperforms state-of-the-art agent tuning approaches."

To address these limitations, we propose the Dual Semantic-Aware Network (DSANet), a novel framework designed to enhance noise robustness in ultrasound video segmentation by fostering mutual semantic awareness between local and global features. Specifically, we introduce an Adjacent-Frame Semantic-Aware (AFSA) module, which constructs a channel-wise similarity matrix to guide feature fusion across adjacent frames, effectively mitigating the impact of random noise without relying on pixel-level relationships. Additionally, we propose a Local-and-Global Semantic-Aware (LGSA) module that reorganizes and fuses temporal unconditional local features, which capture spatial details independently at each frame, with conditional global features that incorporate temporal context from adjacent frames. This integration facilitates multi-level semantic representation, significantly improving the model's resilience to noise interference. Extensive evaluations on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that DSANet substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in segmentation accuracy. Moreover, since our model avoids pixel-level feature dependencies, it achieves significantly higher inference FPS than video-based methods, and even surpasses some image-based models.

Objectomaly achieves state-of-the-art performance on key OoD segmentation benchmarks, including SMIYC AnomalyTrack/ObstacleTrack and RoadAnomaly, improving both pixel-level (AuPRC up to 96.99, FPR$_{95}$ down to 0.07) and component-level (F1$-$score up to 83.44) metrics. Ablation studies and qualitative results on real-world driving videos further validate the robustness and generalizability of our method. Code will be released upon publication."

        "summary": "arXiv:2507.07464v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: With the increasing deployment of intelligent CCTV systems in outdoor environments, there is a growing demand for face recognition systems optimized for challenging weather conditions. Adverse weather significantly degrades image quality, which in turn reduces recognition accuracy. Although recent face image restoration (FIR) models based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models have shown progress, their performance remains limited due to the lack of dedicated modules that explicitly address weather-induced degradations. This leads to distorted facial textures and structures. To address these limitations, we propose a novel GAN-based blind FIR framework that integrates two key components: local Statistical Facial Feature Transformation (SFFT) and Degradation-Agnostic Feature Embedding (DAFE). The local SFFT module enhances facial structure and color fidelity by aligning the local statistical distributions of low-quality (LQ) facial regions with those of high-quality (HQ) counterparts. Complementarily, the DAFE module enables robust statistical facial feature extraction under adverse weather conditions by aligning LQ and HQ encoder representations, thereby making the restoration process adaptive to severe weather-induced degradations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed degradation-agnostic SFFT model outperforms existing state-of-the-art FIR methods based on GAN and diffusion models, particularly in suppressing texture distortions and accurately reconstructing facial structures. Furthermore, both the SFFT and DAFE modules are empirically validated in enhancing structural fidelity and perceptual quality in face restoration under challenging weather scenarios."

However, the VOT community has largely overlooked video data-privacy issues, as many private videos have been collected and used for training commercial models without authorization. To alleviate these issues, this paper presents the first investigation on preventing personal video data from unauthorized exploitation by deep trackers. Existing methods for preventing unauthorized data use primarily focus on image-based tasks (e.g., image classification), directly applying them to videos reveals several limitations, including inefficiency, limited effectiveness, and poor generalizability. To address these issues, we propose a novel generative framework for generating Temporal Unlearnable Examples (TUEs), and whose efficient computation makes it scalable for usage on large-scale video datasets. The trackers trained w/ TUEs heavily rely on unlearnable noises for temporal matching, ignoring the original data structure and thus ensuring training video data-privacy. To enhance the effectiveness of TUEs, we introduce a temporal contrastive loss, which further corrupts the learning of existing trackers when using our TUEs for training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in video data-privacy protection, with strong transferability across VOT models, datasets, and temporal matching tasks."

We introduce the Bullshit Index, a novel metric quantifying LLMs' indifference to truth, and propose a complementary taxonomy analyzing four qualitative forms of bullshit: empty rhetoric, paltering, weasel words, and unverified claims. We conduct empirical evaluations on the Marketplace dataset, the Political Neutrality dataset, and our new BullshitEval benchmark (2,400 scenarios spanning 100 AI assistants) explicitly designed to evaluate machine bullshit. Our results demonstrate that model fine-tuning with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) significantly exacerbates bullshit and inference-time chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting notably amplify specific bullshit forms, particularly empty rhetoric and paltering.

While pre-trained transformers significantly improve MTL performance, their fixed network capacity and rigid structure limit adaptability. Previous dynamic network architectures attempt to address this but are inefficient as they directly convert shared parameters into task-specific ones. We propose Dynamic Token Modulation and Expansion (DTME-MTL), a framework applicable to any transformer-based MTL architecture. DTME-MTL enhances adaptability and reduces overfitting by identifying gradient conflicts in token space and applying adaptive solutions based on conflict type. Unlike prior methods that mitigate negative transfer by duplicating network parameters, DTME-MTL operates entirely in token space, enabling efficient adaptation without excessive parameter growth. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DTME-MTL consistently improves multi-task performance with minimal computational overhead, offering a scalable and effective solution for enhancing transformer-based MTL models."

Motivated by this, we introduce PLAN-TUNING, a unified post-training framework that (i) distills synthetic task decompositions (termed \"planning trajectories\") from large-scale LLMs and (ii) fine-tunes smaller models via supervised and reinforcement-learning objectives designed to mimic these planning processes to improve complex reasoning.

In order to evaluate metrics and radiomic features, quantifying the state of atherosclerosis, accurate segmentation is important. However, the complex morphology of plaques and the scarcity of labeled data poses significant challenges. In this work, we address these problems and propose a semi-supervised deep learning-based approach designed to effectively integrate multi-sequence MRI data for the segmentation of carotid artery vessel wall and plaque. The proposed algorithm consists of two networks: a coarse localization model identifies the region of interest guided by some prior knowledge on the position and number of carotid arteries, followed by a fine segmentation model for precise delineation of vessel walls and plaques. To effectively integrate complementary information across different MRI sequences, we investigate different fusion strategies and introduce a multi-level multi-sequence version of U-Net architecture. To address the challenges of limited labeled data and the complexity of carotid artery MRI, we propose a semi-supervised approach that enforces consistency under various input transformations. Our approach is evaluated on 52 patients with arteriosclerosis, each with five MRI sequences. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and emphasize the role of fusion point selection in U-Net-based architectures. To validate the accuracy of our results, we also include an expert-based assessment of model performance.

In this study, we propose a named entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE) approach using DyGIE++ with multiple pre-trained BERT variants, including MatSciBERT and PubMedBERT, to extract ORR catalyst-related information from the scientific literature, which is compiled into a fuel cell corpus for materials informatics (FC-CoMIcs). A comprehensive dataset was constructed manually by identifying 12 critical entities and two relationship types between pairs of the entities. Our methodology involves data annotation, integration, and fine-tuning of transformer-based models to enhance information extraction accuracy. We assess the impact of different BERT variants on extraction performance and investigate the effects of annotation consistency. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the fine-tuned PubMedBERT model achieves the highest NER F1-score of 82.19% and the MatSciBERT model attains the best RE F1-score of 66.10%. Furthermore, the comparison with human annotators highlights the reliability of fine-tuned models for ORR catalyst extraction, demonstrating their potential for scalable and automated literature analysis.

In this paper, we propose GGMotion, a group graph dynamics-kinematics network that models human topology in groups to better leverage dynamics and kinematics priors. To preserve the geometric equivariance in 3D space, we propose a novel radial field for the graph network that captures more comprehensive spatio-temporal dependencies by aggregating joint features through spatial and temporal edges. Inter-group and intra-group interaction modules are employed to capture the dependencies of joints at different scales. Combined with equivariant multilayer perceptrons (MLP), joint position features are updated in each group through parallelized dynamics-kinematics propagation to improve physical plausibility.

        "summary": "arXiv:2507.07521v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Trajectory modeling of dense points usually employs implicit deformation fields, represented as neural networks that map coordinates to relate canonical spatial positions to temporal offsets. However, the inductive biases inherent in neural networks can hinder spatial coherence in ill-posed scenarios. Current methods focus either on enhancing encoding strategies for deformation fields, often resulting in opaque and less intuitive models, or adopt explicit techniques like linear blend skinning, which rely on heuristic-based node initialization. Additionally, the potential of implicit representations for interpolating sparse temporal signals remains under-explored. To address these challenges, we propose a spline-based trajectory representation, where the number of knots explicitly determines the degrees of freedom. This approach enables efficient analytical derivation of velocities, preserving spatial coherence and accelerations, while mitigating temporal fluctuations. To model knot characteristics in both spatial and temporal domains, we introduce a novel low-rank time-variant spatial encoding, replacing conventional coupled spatiotemporal techniques. Our method demonstrates superior performance in temporal interpolation for fitting continuous fields with sparse inputs. Furthermore, it achieves competitive dynamic scene reconstruction quality compared to state-of-the-art methods while enhancing motion coherence without relying on linear blend skinning or as-rigid-as-possible constraints."

For each task, scientists carefully choose appropriate modalities or leverage data from purpose-built instruments. Recent work on remote sensing foundation models pre-trains computer vision models on large amounts of remote sensing data. These large-scale models tend to focus on specific modalities, often optical RGB or multispectral data. For many important applications, this introduces a mismatch between the application modalities and the pre-training data. Moreover, the large size of foundation models makes them expensive and difficult to fine-tune on typically small datasets for each task. We address this mismatch with MAPEX, a remote sensing foundation model based on mixture-of-modality experts. MAPEX is pre-trained on multi-modal remote sensing data with a novel modality-conditioned token routing mechanism that elicits modality-specific experts. To apply the model on a specific task, we propose a modality aware pruning technique, which only retains experts specialized for the task modalities. This yields efficient modality-specific models while simplifying fine-tuning and deployment for the modalities of interest. We experimentally validate MAPEX on diverse remote sensing datasets and show strong performance compared to fully supervised training and state-of-the-art remote sensing foundation models.

Conversely, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) effectively translate such data into interpretable concepts but are limited by their reliance on low-capacity linear predictors. In this work, we introduce the Neural Concept Verifier (NCV), a unified framework combining PVGs with concept encodings for interpretable, nonlinear classification in high-dimensional settings. NCV achieves this by utilizing recent minimally supervised concept discovery models to extract structured concept encodings from raw inputs. A prover then selects a subset of these encodings, which a verifier -- implemented as a nonlinear predictor -- uses exclusively for decision-making. Our evaluations show that NCV outperforms CBM and pixel-based PVG classifier baselines on high-dimensional, logically complex datasets and also helps mitigate shortcut behavior. Overall, we demonstrate NCV as a promising step toward performative, verifiable AI."

We show that LLMs, when paired with carefully designed prompts, can match or outperform fine-tuned smaller language models (SLMs), particularly in noisy or low-quality data settings.

Prior work in this context has mostly focused on generation and relied on benchmarks derived from open-domain sources, most notably Wikipedia. In such settings, retrieval challenges often remain hidden due to language imbalances, overlap with pretraining data, and memorized content. To address this gap, we study Arabic-English RAG in a domain-specific setting using benchmarks derived from real-world corporate datasets. Our benchmarks include all combinations of languages for the user query and the supporting document, drawn independently and uniformly at random. This enables a systematic study of multilingual retrieval behavior.\n  Our findings reveal that retrieval is a critical bottleneck in cross-lingual domain-specific scenarios, with significant performance drops occurring when the user query and supporting document languages differ. A key insight is that these failures stem primarily from the retriever's difficulty in ranking documents across languages. Finally, we propose a simple retrieval strategy that addresses this source of failure by enforcing equal retrieval from both languages, resulting in substantial improvements in cross-lingual and overall performance. These results highlight meaningful opportunities for improving multilingual retrieval, particularly in practical, real-world RAG applications."

The demand for real-time AD has surged with the rise of the (Industrial) Internet of Things, where massive volumes of multivariate sensor data must be processed instantaneously. Real-time AD requires methods that not only handle high-dimensional streaming data but also operate in a single-pass manner, without the burden of storing historical instances, thereby ensuring minimal memory usage and fast decision-making. We propose DAD, a novel real-time decorrelation-based anomaly detection method for multivariate time series, based on an online decorrelation learning approach. Unlike traditional proximity-based or reconstruction-based detectors that process entire data or windowed instances, DAD dynamically learns and monitors the correlation structure of data sample by sample in a single pass, enabling efficient and effective detection. To support more realistic benchmarking practices, we also introduce a practical hyperparameter tuning strategy tailored for real-time anomaly detection scenarios. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that DAD achieves the most consistent and superior performance across diverse anomaly types compared to state-of-the-art methods. Crucially, its robustness to increasing dimensionality makes it particularly well-suited for real-time, high-dimensional data streams. Ultimately, DAD not only strikes an optimal balance between detection efficacy and computational efficiency but also sets a new standard for real-time, memory-constrained anomaly detection."

While these methods exhibit synergy in language-only models, their joint effectiveness in VLMs remains uncertain. We present a systematic investigation into the distinct roles and interplay of long-CoT SFT and RL across multiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks. We find that SFT improves performance on difficult questions by in-depth, structured reasoning, but introduces verbosity and degrades performance on simpler ones. In contrast, RL promotes generalization and brevity, yielding consistent improvements across all difficulty levels, though the improvements on the hardest questions are less prominent compared to SFT. Surprisingly, combining them through two-staged, interleaved, or progressive training strategies, as well as data mixing and model merging, all fails to produce additive benefits, instead leading to trade-offs in accuracy, reasoning style, and response length. This ``synergy dilemma'' highlights the need for more seamless and adaptive approaches to unlock the full potential of combined post-training techniques for reasoning VLMs."

We find this bottleneck is widespread and stems not from poor perception, but from failures in the language model's reasoning pathways. We demonstrate this is a solvable alignment issue. The required intervention, however, is task-dependent: activating existing pathways suffices for semantic concepts, while complex relational reasoning requires adapting core model weights. Using postfix tuning as a methodological control, we find strong evidence for powerful, dormant reasoning pathways within VLMs. However, for complex relational tasks requiring deeper adaptation, explicitly improving representation quality causes the model to fail on new prompt formats despite its embeddings remaining well separated. Ultimately, this work provides a new lens for VLM analysis, showing that robust reasoning is a matter of targeted alignment, not simply improved representation learning."

These factors collectively lead to unreliable class activation maps and semantically ambiguous pseudo-labels, ultimately compromising the model's ability to learn discriminative feature representations.

To mitigate these issues, 3GPP introduced conditional handovers (CHOs), a new type of HO that enables the preparation (i.e., resource allocation) of multiple cells for a single user to increase the chance of HO success and decrease the delays in the procedure. Despite its advantages, CHO introduces new challenges that must be addressed, including efficient resource allocation and managing signaling/communication overhead from frequent cell preparations and releases.

To bridge this gap, this work presents HOTA: Hierarchical Overlap-Tiling Aggregation, a plug-and-play, multi-scale inference strategy. When combined with SegFormer and a dual-constraint depth estimation module, this approach forms a complete 3D flood-mapping pipeline. HOTA applies overlapping tiles of different sizes to multispectral Sentinel-2 images only during inference, enabling the SegFormer model to capture both local features and kilometre-scale inundation without changing the network weights or retraining. The subsequent depth module is based on a digital elevation model (DEM) differencing method, which refines the 2D mask and estimates flood depth by enforcing (i) zero depth along the flood boundary and (ii) near-constant flood volume with respect to the DEM. A case study on the March 2021 Kempsey (Australia) flood shows that HOTA, when coupled with SegFormer, improves IoU from 73\\% (U-Net baseline) to 84\\%. The resulting 3D surface achieves a mean absolute boundary error of less than 0.5 m.

To optimize this model, we design a novel multi-stage training strategy consisting of pose-controllable latent IdentityNet training, hair extractor training, and temporal attention training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method accurately transfers detailed and realistic hairstyles to source subjects while achieving seamless and consistent results across views, significantly outperforming existing methods and establishing a new benchmark in multi-view hair transfer.

To close the loop between sensing and actuation, both the detection and the generation of in-body molecular communication (MC) signals is key. However, generating signals inside the human body, e.g., via synthetic nanodevices, poses a challenge in SMC, due to technological obstacles as well as legal, safety, and ethical issues. Hence, this paper considers an SMC system in which signals are generated indirectly via the modulation of a natural in-body MC system, namely the gut-brain axis (GBA). Therapeutic GBA modulation is already established as treatment for neurological diseases, e.g., drug refractory epilepsy (DRE), and performed via the administration of nutritional supplements or specific diets. However, the molecular signaling pathways that mediate the effect of such treatments are mostly unknown. Consequently, existing treatments are standardized or designed heuristically and able to help only some patients while failing to help others. In this paper, we propose to leverage personal health data, e.g., gathered by in-body IoBNT devices, to design more versatile and robust GBA modulation-based treatments as compared to the existing ones. To show the feasibility of our approach, we define a catalog of theoretical requirements for therapeutic GBA modulation. Then, we propose a machine learning model to verify these requirements for practical scenarios when only limited data on the GBA modulation exists. By evaluating the proposed model on several datasets, we confirm its excellent accuracy in identifying different modulators of the GBA. Finally, we utilize the proposed model to identify specific modulatory pathways that play an important role for therapeutic GBA modulation."

ViLU constructs an uncertainty-aware multi-modal representation by integrating the visual embedding, the predicted textual embedding, and an image-conditioned textual representation via cross-attention. Unlike traditional UQ methods based on loss prediction, ViLU trains an uncertainty predictor as a binary classifier to distinguish correct from incorrect predictions using a weighted binary cross-entropy loss, making it loss-agnostic.

Extensive experiments on diverse datasets show the significant gains of our method compared to state-of-the-art failure prediction methods.

We propose SLOGAN (Sparse Causal Discovery with Generative Intervention), a novel approach that achieves stable graph representation transfer through sparse causal modeling and dynamic intervention mechanisms. Specifically, SLOGAN first constructs a sparse causal graph structure, leveraging mutual information bottleneck constraints to disentangle sparse, stable causal features while compressing domain-dependent spurious correlations through variational inference. To address residual spurious correlations, we innovatively design a generative intervention mechanism that breaks local spurious couplings through cross-domain feature recombination while maintaining causal feature semantic consistency via covariance constraints. Furthermore, to mitigate error accumulation in target domain pseudo-labels, we introduce a category-adaptive dynamic calibration strategy, ensuring stable discriminative learning. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that SLOGAN significantly outperforms existing baselines."

In this context, EEG-based Deep Learning (DL) models have shown promising results due to their ability to discover highly nonlinear patterns within the signal. However, current state-of-the-art DL models suffer from poor generalizability caused by high inter-subject variability. This high variability underscores the need for enhancing model generalizability by developing new architectures better tailored to EEG data. This paper introduces TransformEEG, a hybrid Convolutional-Transformer designed for Parkinson's disease detection using EEG data. Unlike transformer models based on the EEGNet structure, TransformEEG incorporates a depthwise convolutional tokenizer. This tokenizer is specialized in generating tokens composed by channel-specific features, which enables more effective feature mixing within the self-attention layers of the transformer encoder. To evaluate the proposed model, four public datasets comprising 290 subjects (140 PD patients, 150 healthy controls) were harmonized and aggregated. A 10-outer, 10-inner Nested-Leave-N-Subjects-Out (N-LNSO) cross-validation was performed to provide an unbiased comparison against seven other consolidated EEG deep learning models. TransformEEG achieved the highest balanced accuracy's median (78.45%) as well as the lowest interquartile range (6.37%) across all the N-LNSO partitions. When combined with data augmentation and threshold correction, median accuracy increased to 80.10%, with an interquartile range of 5.74%. In conclusion, TransformEEG produces more consistent and less skewed results. It demonstrates a substantial reduction in variability and more reliable PD detection using EEG data compared to the other investigated models."

However, most existing methods are limited by domain specificity (e.g., facial or human videos) or an excessive dependence on high-level text guidance, which often fails to capture motion details and results in unrealistic reconstructions. To address these challenges, we propose a Trajectory-Guided Generative Video Coding framework (dubbed T-GVC). T-GVC employs a semantic-aware sparse motion sampling pipeline to effectively bridge low-level motion tracking with high-level semantic understanding by extracting pixel-wise motion as sparse trajectory points based on their semantic importance, not only significantly reducing the bitrate but also preserving critical temporal semantic information. In addition, by incorporating trajectory-aligned loss constraints into diffusion processes, we introduce a training-free latent space guidance mechanism to ensure physically plausible motion patterns without sacrificing the inherent capabilities of generative models. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms both traditional codecs and state-of-the-art end-to-end video compression methods under ULB conditions. Furthermore, additional experiments confirm that our approach achieves more precise motion control than existing text-guided methods, paving the way for a novel direction of generative video coding guided by geometric motion modeling."

The de facto approach to solving the problem is to leverage language models that (iteratively) retrieve and reason through the retrieved documents, until the model has sufficient information to generate an answer. Attempts at improving this approach focus on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) metrics such as accuracy and recall and can be categorized into two types: (a) fine-tuning on large question answering (QA) datasets augmented with chain-of-thought traces, and (b) leveraging RL-based fine-tuning techniques that rely on question-document relevance signals. However, efficiency in the number of retrieval searches is an equally important metric, which has received less attention. In this work, we show that: (1) Large-scale fine-tuning is not needed to improve RAG metrics, contrary to popular claims in recent literature. Specifically, a standard ReAct pipeline with improved prompts can outperform state-of-the-art methods on benchmarks such as HotPotQA. (2) Supervised and RL-based fine-tuning can help RAG from the perspective of frugality, i.e., the latency due to number of searches at inference time. For example, we show that we can achieve competitive RAG metrics at nearly half the cost (in terms of number of searches) on popular RAG benchmarks, using the same base model, and at a small training cost (1000 examples)."

However, these models often exhibit demographic biases, particularly with respect to age, which can compromise their fairness and reliability. In this work, we present a comprehensive study of age-related bias in deep FER models, with a particular focus on the elderly population. We first investigate whether recognition performance varies across age groups, which expressions are most affected, and whether model attention differs depending on age. Using Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, we identify systematic disparities in expression recognition and attention patterns, especially for \"neutral\", \"sadness\", and \"anger\" in elderly individuals. Based on these findings, we propose and evaluate three bias mitigation strategies: Multi-task Learning, Multi-modal Input, and Age-weighted Loss. Our models are trained on a large-scale dataset, AffectNet, with automatically estimated age labels and validated on balanced benchmark datasets that include underrepresented age groups. Results show consistent improvements in recognition accuracy for elderly individuals, particularly for the most error-prone expressions. Saliency heatmap analysis reveals that models trained with age-aware strategies attend to more relevant facial regions for each age group, helping to explain the observed improvements. These findings suggest that age-related bias in FER can be effectively mitigated using simple training modifications, and that even approximate demographic labels can be valuable for promoting fairness in large-scale affective computing systems."

MolCLIP designs a molecule-auxiliary CLIP framework to guide video features in learning the distribution of the molecular latent space. Furthermore, we integrate a metric learning strategy with MolCLIP to optimize the aggregation of video features. Experimental results on the MitoDataset demonstrate that MolCLIP achieves improvements of 51.2% and 20.5% in mAP for drug identification and MoA recognition, respectively."

Our research aims to predict this potential by identifying the growth peak and analyzing cervical vertebra morphology solely through lateral cephalometric radiographs. We accomplish this by comprehensively analyzing cervical vertebral maturation (CVM) features from these radiographs. This methodology provides clinicians with a reliable and efficient tool to determine the optimal timings for orthodontic interventions, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes. A crucial aspect of this approach is the meticulous annotation of keypoints on the cervical vertebrae, a task often challenged by its labor-intensive nature. To mitigate this, we introduce Attend-and-Refine Network (ARNet), a user-interactive, deep learning-based model designed to streamline the annotation process. ARNet features Interaction-guided recalibration network, which adaptively recalibrates image features in response to user feedback, coupled with a morphology-aware loss function that preserves the structural consistency of keypoints. This novel approach substantially reduces manual effort in keypoint identification, thereby enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of the process. Extensively validated across various datasets, ARNet demonstrates remarkable performance and exhibits wide-ranging applicability in medical imaging. In conclusion, our research offers an effective AI-assisted diagnostic tool for assessing growth potential in pediatric orthodontics, marking a significant advancement in the field."

Our main result shows that $\\mathbb{E}[EDim(\\ell)]=m[1-(1-2/\\pi)^\\ell]+O(e^{-c m})$ so that the rank deficit decays geometrically with ratio $1-2 / \\pi \\approx 0.3634$. We also prove a sub-Gaussian concentration bound, and identify the \"revival\" depths at which the expected rank attains local maxima. In particular, these peaks occur at depths $\\ell_k^*\\approx(k+1/2)\\pi/\\log(1/\\rho)$ with height $\\approx (1-e^{-\\pi/2}) m \\approx 0.79m$. We further show that this oscillatory rank behavior is a finite-width phenomenon: under orthogonal weight initialization or strong negative-slope leaky-ReLU, the rank remains (nearly) full. These results provide a precise characterization of how random ReLU layers alternately collapse and partially revive the subspace of input variations, adding nuance to prior work on expressivity of deep networks."

While previous research on DFER has concentrated on feature learning from a deep learning perspective, we put forward an AU-enhanced Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition architecture, namely AU-DFER, that incorporates AU-expression knowledge to enhance the effectiveness of deep learning modeling. In particular, the contribution of the Action Units(AUs) to different expressions is quantified, and a weight matrix is designed to incorporate a priori knowledge. Subsequently, the knowledge is integrated with the learning outcomes of a conventional deep learning network through the introduction of AU loss. The design is incorporated into the existing optimal model for dynamic expression recognition for the purpose of validation. Experiments are conducted on three recent mainstream open-source approaches to DFER on the principal datasets in this field. The results demonstrate that the proposed architecture outperforms the state-of-the-art(SOTA) methods without the need for additional arithmetic and generally produces improved results. Furthermore, we investigate the potential of AU loss function redesign to address data label imbalance issues in established dynamic expression datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to integrate quantified AU-expression knowledge into various DFER models. We also devise strategies to tackle label imbalance, or minor class problems. Our findings suggest that employing a diverse strategy of loss function design can enhance the effectiveness of DFER.

While CoT is assumed to improve grounding and accuracy in LVLMs, our experiments reveal a key challenge: existing LVLMs often ignore the contents of generated rationales in CoT reasoning. To address this, we re-formulate multi-modal CoT reasoning as a KL-constrained reward maximization focused on rationale-conditional log-likelihood. As the optimal solution, we propose rationale-enhanced decoding (RED), a novel plug-and-play inference-time decoding strategy. RED harmonizes visual and rationale information by multiplying distinct image-conditional and rationale-conditional next token distributions. Extensive experiments show that RED consistently and significantly improves reasoning over standard CoT and other decoding methods across multiple benchmarks and LVLMs. Our work offers a practical and effective approach to improve both the faithfulness and accuracy of CoT reasoning in LVLMs, paving the way for more reliable rationale-grounded multi-modal systems."

Recently, Mamba-based methods have achieved promising performance across various vision tasks; however, they struggle with the UMDE task because their inflexible state scanning strategies fail to model the structural features of underwater images effectively. Meanwhile, existing UMDE datasets usually contain unreliable depth labels, leading to incorrect object-depth relationships between underwater images and their corresponding depth maps. To overcome these limitations, we develop a novel tree-aware Mamba method, dubbed Tree-Mamba, for estimating accurate monocular depth maps from underwater degraded images. Specifically, we propose a tree-aware scanning strategy that adaptively constructs a minimum spanning tree based on feature similarity. The spatial topological features among the tree nodes are then flexibly aggregated through bottom-up and top-down traversals, enabling stronger multi-scale feature representation capabilities. Moreover, we construct an underwater depth estimation benchmark (called BlueDepth), which consists of 38,162 underwater image pairs with reliable depth labels. This benchmark serves as a foundational dataset for training existing deep learning-based UMDE methods to learn accurate object-depth relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed Tree-Mamba over several leading methods in both qualitative results and quantitative evaluations with competitive computational efficiency.

Various methods have been developed to compute attention scores, including multi-head attention (MHA), multi-query attention, group-query attention and so on. We further analyze the MHA and observe that its performance improves as the number of attention heads increases, provided the hidden size per head remains sufficiently large. Therefore, increasing both the head count and hidden size per head with minimal parameter overhead can lead to significant performance gains at a low cost. Motivated by this insight, we introduce Simulated Attention Score (SAS), which maintains a compact model size while simulating a larger number of attention heads and hidden feature dimension per head. This is achieved by projecting a low-dimensional head representation into a higher-dimensional space, effectively increasing attention capacity without increasing parameter count. Beyond the head representations, we further extend the simulation approach to feature dimension of the key and query embeddings, enhancing expressiveness by mimicking the behavior of a larger model while preserving the original model size. To control the parameter cost, we also propose Parameter-Efficient Attention Aggregation (PEAA). Comprehensive experiments on a variety of datasets and tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SAS method, achieving significant improvements over different attention variants."

        "summary": "arXiv:2507.07695v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Fine-tuning is an immensely resource-intensive process when retraining Large Language Models (LLMs) to incorporate a larger body of knowledge. Although many fine-tuning techniques have been developed to reduce the time and computational cost involved, the challenge persists as LLMs continue to grow in size and complexity. To address this, a new approach to knowledge expansion in LLMs is needed. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers one such alternative by storing external knowledge in a database and retrieving relevant chunks to support question answering. However, naive implementations of RAG face significant limitations in scalability and answer accuracy. This paper introduces KeyKnowledgeRAG (K2RAG), a novel framework designed to overcome these limitations. Inspired by the divide-and-conquer paradigm, K2RAG integrates dense and sparse vector search, knowledge graphs, and text summarization to improve retrieval quality and system efficiency. The framework also includes a preprocessing step that summarizes the training data, significantly reducing the training time. K2RAG was evaluated using the MultiHopRAG dataset, where the proposed pipeline was trained on the document corpus and tested on a separate evaluation set. Results demonstrated notable improvements over common naive RAG implementations. K2RAG achieved the highest mean answer similarity score of 0.57, and reached the highest third quartile (Q3) similarity of 0.82, indicating better alignment with ground-truth answers. In addition to improved accuracy, the framework proved highly efficient. The summarization step reduced the average training time of individual components by 93%, and execution speed was up to 40% faster than traditional knowledge graph-based RAG systems. K2RAG also demonstrated superior scalability, requiring three times less VRAM than several naive RAG implementations tested in this study."

Traditionally, transmitting embeddings instead of raw text has been seen as privacy-preserving. However, recent methods such as Vec2Text challenge this assumption by demonstrating that controlled decoding can successfully reconstruct original texts from black-box embeddings. The unexpectedly strong results reported by Vec2Text motivated us to conduct further verification, particularly considering the typically non-intuitive and opaque structure of high-dimensional embedding spaces. In this work, we reproduce the Vec2Text framework and evaluate it from two perspectives: (1) validating the original claims, and (2) extending the study through targeted experiments. First, we successfully replicate the original key results in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings, with only minor discrepancies arising due to missing artifacts, such as model checkpoints and dataset splits. Furthermore, we extend the study by conducting a parameter sensitivity analysis, evaluating the feasibility of reconstructing sensitive inputs (e.g., passwords), and exploring embedding quantization as a lightweight privacy defense. Our results show that Vec2Text is effective under ideal conditions, capable of reconstructing even password-like sequences that lack clear semantics. However, we identify key limitations, including its sensitivity to input sequence length. We also find that Gaussian noise and quantization techniques can mitigate the privacy risks posed by Vec2Text, with quantization offering a simpler and more widely applicable solution. Our findings emphasize the need for caution in using text embeddings and highlight the importance of further research into robust defense mechanisms for NLP systems."

However, their performance is typically limited by class imbalance, both within the replay buffer due to limited global awareness and between replayed and newly arrived classes. To address this issue, we propose a class wise balancing data replay method for FCIL (FedCBDR), which employs a global coordination mechanism for class-level memory construction and reweights the learning objective to alleviate the aforementioned imbalances. Specifically, FedCBDR has two key components: 1) the global-perspective data replay module reconstructs global representations of prior task in a privacy-preserving manner, which then guides a class-aware and importance-sensitive sampling strategy to achieve balanced replay; 2) Subsequently, to handle class imbalance across tasks, the task aware temperature scaling module adaptively adjusts the temperature of logits at both class and instance levels based on task dynamics, which reduces the model's overconfidence in majority classes while enhancing its sensitivity to minority classes. Experimental results verified that FedCBDR achieves balanced class-wise sampling under heterogeneous data distributions and improves generalization under task imbalance between earlier and recent tasks, yielding a 2%-15% Top-1 accuracy improvement over six state-of-the-art methods."

Traditional graph-based models typically assume memoryless movement, limiting their ability to capture sequential dependencies inherent in real-world mobility patterns. In this study, we introduce a novel higher-order network framework for modeling memory-dependent dynamics in transportation systems. By extending classical graph representations through higher-order Markov chains and de Bruijn graph structures, our framework encodes the spatial and temporal ordering of traversed paths, enabling the analysis of structurally and functionally critical components with improved fidelity. We generalize key network analytics, including betweenness centrality, PageRank, and next-step prediction, to this higher-order setting and validate our approach on the Sioux Falls transportation network using agent-based trajectory data generated with MATSim. Experimental results demonstrate that higher-order models outperform first-order baselines across multiple tasks, with the third-order model achieving an optimal balance between predictive accuracy and model complexity. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating memory effects into network-based transportation analysis and offer a scalable, data-driven methodology for capturing complex mobility behaviors in infrastructure systems."

However, SAM's architecture is designed for 2D images and does not extend naturally to 3D volumetric data such as CT or MRI scans. Adapting 2D models to 3D typically involves autoregressive strategies, where predictions are propagated slice by slice, resulting in increased inference complexity. Processing large 3D volumes also requires significant computational resources, often leading existing 3D methods to also adopt complex strategies like sliding-window inference to manage memory usage, at the cost of longer inference times and greater implementation complexity. In this paper, we present a simplified 3D promptable segmentation method, inspired by SegVol, designed to reduce inference time and eliminate prompt management complexities associated with sliding windows while achieving state-of-the-art performance."

Furthermore, we propose an energy-based decoding method, which dynamically selects the hidden states from the layer with minimal energy score. It is simple yet effective in reducing the bias for the yes ratio while boosting performance across three benchmarks (POPE, MME, and MMVP). Our method consistently improves accuracy and F1 score on three VQA datasets across three commonly used VLMs over several baseline methods. The average accuracy improvement is 4.82% compared to greedy decoding. Moreover, the average yes-ratio gap reduction is 8.81%, meaning the proposed method is less biased as shown in Figure 1."

However, most existing processing approaches accumulate events to low-rate frames or space-time voxels which limits the early prediction capabilities. In contrast, spiking neural networks (SNNs) can process the events at a high-rate for early predictions, but most works still fall short on final accuracy. In this work, we introduce a high-rate two-stream SNN which closes this gap by outperforming previous work by 2% in final accuracy on the large-scale THU EACT-50 dataset. We benchmark the SNNs within a novel early event-based recognition framework by reporting Top-1 and Top-5 recognition scores for growing observation time.

Evaluating these threats is particularly challenging due to the evolving nature of LLMs and the sophistication required in effectively probing their vulnerabilities. Current benchmarks and evaluation methods struggle to fully address these challenges, leaving gaps in the assessment of LLM vulnerabilities. In this paper, we review existing jailbreak evaluation practices and identify three assumed desiderata for an effective jailbreak evaluation protocol. To address these challenges, we introduce GuardVal, a new evaluation protocol that dynamically generates and refines jailbreak prompts based on the defender LLM's state, providing a more accurate assessment of defender LLMs' capacity to handle safety-critical situations. Moreover, we propose a new optimization method that prevents stagnation during prompt refinement, ensuring the generation of increasingly effective jailbreak prompts that expose deeper weaknesses in the defender LLMs. We apply this protocol to a diverse set of models, from Mistral-7b to GPT-4, across 10 safety domains. Our findings highlight distinct behavioral patterns among the models, offering a comprehensive view of their robustness.

Specifically, precision in the distribution tails suffers due to data imbalance, and computational inefficiencies arise from the need to solve numerous regression problems, particularly in large-scale datasets commonly encountered in industry. To address these limitations, our method leverages multi-task neural networks to estimate conditional outcome distributions while incorporating monotonic shape constraints and multi-threshold label learning to enhance accuracy. To demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our proposed method, we apply our method to both simulated and real-world datasets, including a randomized field experiment aimed at reducing water consumption in the US and a large-scale A/B test from a leading streaming platform in Japan.

While full fine-tuning is often impractical, parameter-efficient fine-tuning -- and particularly side-tuning (ST) -- has emerged as an effective alternative. However, prior ST approaches this problem from a frame-level refinement perspective, overlooking the inherent sparse nature of MR. To address this, we propose the Sparse-Dense Side-Tuner (SDST), the first anchor-free ST architecture for VTG. We also introduce the Reference-based Deformable Self-Attention, a novel mechanism that enhances the context modeling of the deformable attention -- a key limitation of existing anchor-free methods. Additionally, we present the first effective integration of InternVideo2 backbone into an ST framework, showing its profound implications in performance. Overall, our method significantly improves existing ST methods, achieving highly competitive or SOTA results on QVHighlights, TACoS, and Charades-STA, while reducing up to a 73% the parameter count w.r.t. the existing SOTA methods.

Quantitative fluorescence requires paired spectral data in fluorescence (blue light) and reflectance (white light) mode. Blue and white image acquisition needs to be performed sequentially in a potentially dynamic surgical environment. A key component to the fluorescence quantification process is therefore the ability to find dense cross-modal image correspondences between two hyperspectral images taken under these drastically different lighting conditions. We address this challenge with the introduction of X-RAFT, a Recurrent All-Pairs Field Transforms (RAFT) optical flow model modified for cross-modal inputs. We propose using distinct image encoders for each modality pair, and fine-tune these in a self-supervised manner using flow-cycle-consistency on our neurosurgical hyperspectral data. We show an error reduction of 36.6% across our evaluation metrics when comparing to a naive baseline and 27.83% reduction compared to an existing cross-modal optical flow method (CrossRAFT).

It pioneers an innovative dual lens taxonomy that integrates legal reasoning frameworks and professional ontologies to systematically unify historical research and contemporary breakthroughs. Transformer-based LLMs, which exhibit emergent capabilities such as contextual reasoning and generative argumentation, surmount traditional limitations by dynamically capturing legal semantics and unifying evidence reasoning. Significant progress is documented in task generalization, reasoning formalization, workflow integration, and addressing core challenges in text processing, knowledge integration, and evaluation rigor via technical innovations like sparse attention mechanisms and mixture-of-experts architectures. However, widespread adoption of LLM introduces critical challenges: hallucination, explainability deficits, jurisdictional adaptation difficulties, and ethical asymmetry. This review proposes a novel taxonomy that maps legal roles to NLP subtasks and computationally implements the Toulmin argumentation framework, thus systematizing advances in reasoning, retrieval, prediction, and dispute resolution. It identifies key frontiers including low-resource systems, multimodal evidence integration, and dynamic rebuttal handling. Ultimately, this work provides both a technical roadmap for researchers and a conceptual framework for practitioners navigating the algorithmic future, laying a robust foundation for the next era of legal artificial intelligence.

Existing unlearning methods tend to forget shallowly: phenomenon of an unlearned model pretend to forget by adjusting only the model response, while its internal representations retain information sufficiently to restore the forgotten data or behavior. We empirically confirm the widespread shallowness by reverting the forgetting effect of various unlearning methods via training-free performance recovery attack and gradient-inversion-based data reconstruction attack. To address this vulnerability fundamentally, we define a theoretical criterion of ``deep forgetting'' based on one-point-contraction of feature representations of data to forget. We also propose an efficient approximation algorithm, and use it to construct a novel general-purpose unlearning algorithm: One-Point-Contraction (OPC). Empirical evaluations on image classification unlearning benchmarks show that OPC achieves not only effective unlearning performance but also superior resilience against both performance recovery attack and gradient-inversion attack. The distinctive unlearning performance of OPC arises from the deep feature forgetting enforced by its theoretical foundation, and recaps the need for improved robustness of machine unlearning methods."

Geometric inaccuracies caused by shrinkage and deformations can compromise the life and performance of additively manufactured components. Such deviations can be quantified using Digital Volume Correlation (DVC), which compares the computer-aided design (CAD) model with the X-ray Computed Tomography (XCT) geometry of the components produced. However, accurate registration between the two modalities is challenging due to the absence of a ground truth or reference deformation field. In addition, the extremely large data size of high-resolution XCT volumes makes computation difficult. In this work, we present a deep learning-based approach for estimating voxel-wise deformations between CAD and XCT volumes. Our method uses a dynamic patch-based processing strategy to handle high-resolution volumes. In addition to the Dice Score, we introduce a Binary Difference Map (BDM) that quantifies voxel-wise mismatches between binarized CAD and XCT volumes to evaluate the accuracy of the registration. Our approach shows a 9.2\\% improvement in the Dice Score and a 9.9\\% improvement in the voxel match rate compared to classic DVC methods, while reducing the interaction time from days to minutes. This work sets the foundation for deep learning-based DVC methods to generate compensation meshes that can then be used in closed-loop correlations during the AM production process. Such a system would be of great interest to industries since the manufacturing process will become more reliable and efficient, saving time and material."

However, existing approaches typically apply a uniform training objective across all classes, overlooking disparities in class-wise vulnerability. This results in adversarial unfairness: classes with well distinguishable features (strong classes) tend to become more robust, while classes with overlapping or shared features(weak classes) remain disproportionately susceptible to adversarial attacks. We observe that strong classes do not require strong adversaries during training, as their non-robust features are quickly suppressed. In contrast, weak classes benefit from stronger adversaries to effectively reduce their vulnerabilities. Motivated by this, we introduce TRIX, a feature-aware adversarial training framework that adaptively assigns weaker targeted adversaries to strong classes, promoting feature diversity via uniformly sampled targets, and stronger untargeted adversaries to weak classes, enhancing their focused robustness. TRIX further incorporates per-class loss weighting and perturbation strength adjustments, building on prior work, to emphasize weak classes during the optimization. Comprehensive experiments on standard image classification benchmarks, including evaluations under strong attacks such as PGD and AutoAttack, demonstrate that TRIX significantly improves worst-case class accuracy on both clean and adversarial data, reducing inter-class robustness disparities, and preserves overall accuracy. Our results highlight TRIX as a practical step toward fair and effective adversarial defense."

In this work, we formally characterize the generalization space for the cross-environment, multi-objective building energy management task, and formulate the multi-objective contextual RL problem. Such a formulation helps understand the challenges of transferring learned policies across varied operational contexts such as climate and heat convection dynamics under multiple control objectives such as comfort level and energy consumption. We provide a principled way to parameterize such contextual information in realistic building RL environments, and construct a novel benchmark to facilitate the evaluation of generalizable RL algorithms in practical building control tasks. Our results show that existing multi-objective RL methods are capable of achieving reasonable trade-offs between conflicting objectives.

This allows attackers to circumvent traditional, norm-bounded defense strategies such as adversarial training or certified defense strategies. However, due to their unrestricted nature, there are also no guarantees of norm-based imperceptibility, necessitating human evaluations to verify just how authentic these adversarial examples look. While some related work assesses this vital quality of adversarial attacks, none provide statistically significant insights. This issue necessitates a unified framework that supports and streamlines such an assessment for evaluating and comparing unrestricted attacks. To close this gap, we introduce SCOOTER - an open-source, statistically powered framework for evaluating unrestricted adversarial examples. Our contributions are: $(i)$ best-practice guidelines for crowd-study power, compensation, and Likert equivalence bounds to measure imperceptibility; $(ii)$ the first large-scale human vs. model comparison across 346 human participants showing that three color-space attacks and three diffusion-based attacks fail to produce imperceptible images.

However, we find that when models are required to perform multiple tasks under domain shifts, conventional TTT methods suffer from unsynchronized task behavior, where the adaptation steps needed for optimal performance in one task may not align with the requirements of other tasks. To address this, we propose a novel TTT approach called Synchronizing Tasks for Test-time Training (S4T), which enables the concurrent handling of multiple tasks. The core idea behind S4T is that predicting task relations across domain shifts is key to synchronizing tasks during test time. To validate our approach, we apply S4T to conventional multi-task benchmarks, integrating it with traditional TTT protocols. Our empirical results show that S4T outperforms state-of-the-art TTT methods across various benchmarks."

We compare various post-hoc calibration methods, and their interactions with common in-training calibration strategies (e.g., label smoothing), across a wide range of natural shifts, on eight different classification tasks across several imaging domains. We find that: (i) simultaneously applying entropy regularisation and label smoothing yield the best calibrated raw probabilities under dataset shift, (ii) post-hoc calibrators exposed to a small amount of semantic out-of-distribution data (unrelated to the task) are most robust under shift, (iii) recent calibration methods specifically aimed at increasing calibration under shifts do not necessarily offer significant improvements over simpler post-hoc calibration methods, (iv) improving calibration under shifts often comes at the cost of worsening in-distribution calibration. Importantly, these findings hold for randomly initialised classifiers, as well as for those finetuned from foundation models, the latter being consistently better calibrated compared to models trained from scratch. Finally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of ensembling effects, finding that (i) applying calibration prior to ensembling (instead of after) is more effective for calibration under shifts, (ii) for ensembles, OOD exposure deteriorates the ID-shifted calibration trade-off, (iii) ensembling remains one of the most effective methods to improve calibration robustness and, combined with finetuning from foundation models, yields best calibration results overall."

Spatial reasoning, a key capability for understanding spatial relationships between objects, remains underexplored in current 3D vision-language research. Existing datasets often mix semantic cues (e.g., object name) with spatial context, leading models to rely on superficial shortcuts rather than genuinely interpreting spatial relationships. To address this gap, we introduce S\\textsc{urprise}3D, a novel dataset designed to evaluate language-guided spatial reasoning segmentation in complex 3D scenes. S\\textsc{urprise}3D consists of more than 200k vision language pairs across 900+ detailed indoor scenes from ScanNet++ v2, including more than 2.8k unique object classes. The dataset contains 89k+ human-annotated spatial queries deliberately crafted without object name, thereby mitigating shortcut biases in spatial understanding. These queries comprehensively cover various spatial reasoning skills, such as relative position, narrative perspective, parametric perspective, and absolute distance reasoning. Initial benchmarks demonstrate significant challenges for current state-of-the-art expert 3D visual grounding methods and 3D-LLMs, underscoring the necessity of our dataset and the accompanying 3D Spatial Reasoning Segmentation (3D-SRS) benchmark suite. S\\textsc{urprise}3D and 3D-SRS aim to facilitate advancements in spatially aware AI, paving the way for effective embodied interaction and robotic planning.

During training, the state trajectory can deform significantly leading to poor data coverage of the state space. This can cause significant issues for space-oriented training algorithms which e.g. rely on grid structures, tree partitioning, or similar. Besides hindering training, significant state trajectory deformations also deteriorate interpretability and robustness properties. This paper proposes a new type of space-filling regularization that ensures a favorable data distribution in state space via introducing a data-distribution-based penalty. This method is demonstrated in local model network architectures where good interpretability is a major concern. The proposed approach integrates ideas from modeling and design of experiments for state space structures. This is why we present two regularization techniques for the data point distributions of the state trajectories for local affine state space models. Beyond that, we demonstrate the results on a widely known system identification benchmark."

This paper proposes an end-to-end rPPG extraction network that employs 3D convolutional neural networks to reconstruct accurate rPPG signals from raw facial videos.

To address this challenge, we propose Visual Instance-aware Prompt Tuning (ViaPT), which generates instance-aware prompts based on each individual input and fuses them with dataset-level prompts, leveraging Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to retain important prompting information. Moreover, we reveal that VPT-Deep and VPT-Shallow represent two corner cases based on a conceptual understanding, in which they fail to effectively capture instance-specific information, while random dimension reduction on prompts only yields performance between the two extremes. Instead, ViaPT overcomes these limitations by balancing dataset-level and instance-level knowledge, while reducing the amount of learnable parameters compared to VPT-Deep.

Recent research has focused on prompt-based strategies to tackle this issue; however, existing methods are hindered by two major limitations: (1) static prompts lack the flexibility to adapt to varying missing-data conditions, and (2) basic prompt-tuning methods struggle to ensure reliable performance when critical modalities are missing.To address these challenges, we propose a novel Synergistic Prompting (SyP) framework for robust visual recognition with missing modalities. The proposed SyP introduces two key innovations: (I) a Dynamic Adapter, which computes adaptive scaling factors to dynamically generate prompts, replacing static parameters for flexible multi-modal adaptation, and (II) a Synergistic Prompting Strategy, which combines static and dynamic prompts to balance information across modalities, ensuring robust reasoning even when key modalities are missing. The proposed SyP achieves significant performance improvements over existing approaches across three widely-used visual recognition datasets, demonstrating robustness under diverse missing rates and conditions.

However, existing StreamST methods typically operate on sentence-level speech segments, referred to as simultaneous speech translation (SimulST). In practice, they require collaboration with segmentation models to accomplish StreamST, where the truncated speech segments constrain SimulST models to make policy decisions and generate translations based on limited contextual information. Moreover, SimulST models struggle to learn effective policies due to the complexity of speech inputs and cross-lingual generation. To address these challenges, we propose StreamUni, which achieves StreamST through a unified Large Speech-Language Model (LSLM). Specifically, StreamUni incorporates speech Chain-of-Thought (CoT) in guiding the LSLM to generate multi-stage outputs. Leveraging these multi-stage outputs, StreamUni simultaneously accomplishes speech segmentation, policy decision, and translation generation, completing StreamST without requiring massive policy-specific training. Additionally, we propose a streaming CoT training method that enhances low-latency policy decisions and generation capabilities using limited CoT data. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on StreamST tasks."

We propose SAMVAE (Survival Analysis Multimodal Variational Autoencoder), a novel deep learning architecture designed for survival prediction that integrates six data modalities: clinical variables, four molecular profiles, and histopathological images. SAMVAE leverages modality specific encoders to project inputs into a shared latent space, enabling robust survival prediction while preserving modality specific information. Its parametric formulation enables the derivation of clinically meaningful statistics from the output distributions, providing patient-specific insights through interactive multimedia that contribute to more informed clinical decision-making and establish a foundation for interpretable, data-driven survival analysis in oncology. We evaluate SAMVAE on two cancer cohorts breast cancer and lower grade glioma applying tailored preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, and hyperparameter optimization. The results demonstrate the successful integration of multimodal data for both standard survival analysis and competing risks scenarios across different datasets. Our model achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art multimodal survival models.

If such embeddings are semantically consistent, i.e. if similar specifications are mapped into nearby vectors, they enable continuous learning and optimization directly in the semantic space of formulae. However, to translate the optimal continuous representation into a concrete requirement, such embeddings must be invertible. We tackle this issue by training a Transformer-based decoder-only model to invert semantic embeddings of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formulae. STL is a powerful formalism that allows us to describe properties of signals varying over time in an expressive yet concise way. By constructing a small vocabulary from STL syntax, we demonstrate that our proposed model is able to generate valid formulae after only 1 epoch and to generalize to the semantics of the logic in about 10 epochs. Additionally, the model is able to decode a given embedding into formulae that are often simpler in terms of length and nesting while remaining semantically close (or equivalent) to gold references. We show the effectiveness of our methodology across various levels of training formulae complexity to assess the impact of training data on the model's ability to effectively capture the semantic information contained in the embeddings and generalize out-of-distribution. Finally, we deploy our model for solving a requirement mining task, i.e. inferring STL specifications that solve a classification task on trajectories, performing the optimization directly in the semantic space."

While current markerless methods mostly rely on deep learning, transformer-based architectures remain unexplored in this domain, despite their proven performance in trajectory forecasting.\n  Purpose: This work introduces a markerless forecasting approach for lung tumor motion using Vision Transformers (ViT). Two training strategies are evaluated under clinically realistic constraints: a patient-specific (PS) approach that learns individualized motion patterns, and a multi-patient (MP) model designed for generalization. The comparison explicitly accounts for the limited number of images that can be generated between planning and treatment sessions.\n  Methods: Digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) derived from planning 4DCT scans of 31 patients were used to train the MP model; a 32nd patient was held out for evaluation. PS models were trained using only the target patient's planning data. Both models used 16 DRRs per input and predicted tumor motion over a 1-second horizon. Performance was assessed using Average Displacement Error (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE), on both planning (T1) and treatment (T2) data.\n  Results: On T1 data, PS models outperformed MP models across all training set sizes, especially with larger datasets (up to 25,000 DRRs, p < 0.05). However, MP models demonstrated stronger robustness to inter-fractional anatomical variability and achieved comparable performance on T2 data without retraining.\n  Conclusions: This is the first study to apply ViT architectures to markerless tumor motion forecasting. While PS models achieve higher precision, MP models offer robust out-of-the-box performance, well-suited for time-constrained clinical settings."

A fundamental, yet often overlooked, question is whether the conventional auto-regressive objective - where loss is computed only on response tokens, excluding prompt tokens - is truly optimal for instruction tuning. In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of differentially weighting prompt and response tokens in instruction tuning loss, and propose Weighted Instruction Tuning (WIT) as a better alternative to conventional instruction tuning. Through extensive experiments on five language models of different families and scale, three finetuning datasets of different sizes, and five diverse evaluation benchmarks, we show that the standard instruction tuning loss often yields suboptimal performance and limited robustness to input prompt variations. We find that a low-to-moderate weight for prompt tokens coupled with a moderate-to-high weight for response tokens yields the best-performing models across settings and also serve as better starting points for the subsequent preference alignment training. These findings highlight the need to reconsider instruction tuning loss and offer actionable insights for developing more robust and generalizable models.

To leverage the built-in objectness of query-based transformers, which mitigates catastrophic forgetting of mask proposals, current methods often decouple mask generation from the continual learning process. This study, however, identifies two key issues with decoupled frameworks: loss of plasticity and heavy reliance on input data order. To address these, we conduct an in-depth investigation of the built-in objectness and find that highly aggregated image features provide a shortcut for queries to generate masks through simple feature alignment. Based on this, we propose SimCIS, a simple yet powerful baseline for CIS. Its core idea is to directly select image features for query assignment, ensuring \"perfect alignment\" to preserve objectness, while simultaneously allowing queries to select new classes to promote plasticity. To further combat catastrophic forgetting of categories, we introduce cross-stage consistency in selection and an innovative \"visual query\"-based replay mechanism.

It includes 27,346 annotated defect instances from 12 categories, covering the breadth of industrial surface defects. 3D-ADAM uniquely captures an additional 8,110 annotations of machine element features, spanning the range of relevant mechanical design form factors. Unlike existing datasets, 3D-ADAM is captured in a real industrial environment with variations in part position and orientation, camera positioning, ambient lighting conditions, as well as partial occlusions. Our evaluation of SOTA models across various RGB+3D anomaly detection tasks demonstrates the significant challenge this dataset presents to current approaches. We further validated the industrial relevance and quality of the dataset through an expert labelling survey conducted by industry partners. By providing this challenging benchmark, 3D-ADAM aims to accelerate the development of robust 3D Anomaly Detection models capable of meeting the demands of modern manufacturing environments."

Traditional prognostic models, which rely on single data modalities such as radiology, histopathology, or genomics, often fail to capture the full spectrum of disease complexity, resulting in suboptimal predictive accuracy. This study aims to overcome these limitations by proposing a deep learning (DL) framework that integrates multimodal data, including CT, MRI, histopathology whole slide images (WSI), clinical data, and genomic profiles, to improve the prediction of ccRCC recurrence and enhance clinical decision-making. The proposed framework utilizes a comprehensive dataset curated from multiple publicly available sources, including TCGA, TCIA, and CPTAC. To process the diverse modalities, domain-specific models are employed: CLAM, a ResNet50-based model, is used for histopathology WSIs, while MeD-3D, a pre-trained 3D-ResNet18 model, processes CT and MRI images. For structured clinical and genomic data, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is used. These models are designed to extract deep feature embeddings from each modality, which are then fused through an early and late integration architecture. This fusion strategy enables the model to combine complementary information from multiple sources. Additionally, the framework is designed to handle incomplete data, a common challenge in clinical settings, by enabling inference even when certain modalities are missing."

However, the effectiveness of RAG is often hindered by coreferential complexity in retrieved documents, introducing ambiguity that disrupts in-context learning. In this study, we systematically investigate how entity coreference affects both document retrieval and generative performance in RAG-based systems, focusing on retrieval relevance, contextual understanding, and overall response quality. We demonstrate that coreference resolution enhances retrieval effectiveness and improves question-answering (QA) performance. Through comparative analysis of different pooling strategies in retrieval tasks, we find that mean pooling demonstrates superior context capturing ability after applying coreference resolution. In QA tasks, we discover that smaller models benefit more from the disambiguation process, likely due to their limited inherent capacity for handling referential ambiguity. With these findings, this study aims to provide a deeper understanding of the challenges posed by coreferential complexity in RAG, providing guidance for improving retrieval and generation in knowledge-intensive AI applications."

These techniques demonstrate the ability to tackle complex games such as Atari, Go, and other real-world applications, including financial trading. Nevertheless, a significant challenge emerges from the lack of interpretability, particularly when attempting to comprehend the underlying patterns learned, the relative importance of the state features, and how they are integrated to generate the policy's output. For this reason, in mission-critical and real-world settings, it is often preferred to deploy a simpler and more interpretable algorithm, although at the cost of performance. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, supported by theoretical guarantees, that can extract an interpretable policy (e.g., a linear policy) without disregarding the peculiarities of expert behavior. This result is obtained by considering the advantage function, which includes information about why an action is superior to the others. In contrast to previous works, our approach enables the training of an interpretable policy using previously collected experience. The proposed algorithm is empirically evaluated on classic control environments and on a financial trading scenario, demonstrating its ability to extract meaningful information from complex expert policies."

From a theoretical perspective, we analyze how the presence of such a model influences the regret of the decision-making process. We introduce a novel notion called \"model elasticity\", which quantifies the sensitivity of the reward function to the discrepancy between the true covariate and its imputed counterpart. This concept provides a unified way to characterize the regret incurred due to model imputation, regardless of the underlying missingness mechanism. More surprisingly, we show that under the missing at random (MAR) setting, it is possible to sequentially calibrate the pre-trained model using tools from orthogonal statistical learning and doubly robust regression. This calibration significantly improves the quality of the imputed covariates, leading to much better regret guarantees. Our analysis highlights the practical value of having an accurate pre-trained model in sequential decision-making tasks and suggests that model elasticity may serve as a fundamental metric for understanding and improving the integration of pre-trained models in a wide range of data-driven decision-making problems."

Getting to understand how DPO operates from a general principled perspective is crucial because of the huge and diverse application landscape of models, because of the current momentum around DPO, but also -- and importantly -- because many state of the art variations on DPO definitely occupy a small region of the map that we cover.

Benchmarking available methods then becomes paramount to get a clearer view of the research landscape. In particular, in critical domains such as healthcare, a benchmark should not only focus on evaluating downstream performance, but also provide insights about the main differences between methods, and importantly, further consider uncertainty and robustness to ensure a reliable usage of proposed models. For these reasons, we introduce THUNDER, a tile-level benchmark for digital pathology foundation models, allowing for efficient comparison of many models on diverse datasets with a series of downstream tasks, studying their feature spaces and assessing the robustness and uncertainty of predictions informed by their embeddings.

Thus, discovering antibiotics effective against emerging pathogens is becoming increasingly critical. However, existing approaches cannot rapidly identify effective molecules against novel pathogens or emerging drug-resistant strains. Here, we introduce ApexOracle, an artificial intelligence (AI) model that both predicts the antibacterial potency of existing compounds and designs de novo molecules active against strains it has never encountered. Departing from models that rely solely on molecular features, ApexOracle incorporates pathogen-specific context through the integration of molecular features captured via a foundational discrete diffusion language model and a dual-embedding framework that combines genomic- and literature-derived strain representations. Across diverse bacterial species and chemical modalities, ApexOracle consistently outperformed state-of-the-art approaches in activity prediction and demonstrated reliable transferability to novel pathogens with little or no antimicrobial data. Its unified representation-generation architecture further enables the in silico creation of \"new-to-nature\" molecules with high predicted efficacy against priority threats. By pairing rapid activity prediction with targeted molecular generation, ApexOracle offers a scalable strategy for countering AMR and preparing for future infectious-disease outbreaks."

Building upon Alpay Algebra IV's empathetic embedding concept, we introduce a nested game-theoretic structure where the alignment process between AI systems and documents becomes a meta-game containing embedded decision problems. We formalize this through a composite operator $\\phi(\\cdot, \\gamma(\\cdot))$ where $\\phi$ drives the main semantic convergence while $\\gamma$ resolves local sub-games. The resulting framework demonstrates that game-theoretic reasoning emerges naturally from fixed-point iteration rather than being imposed externally. We prove a Game Theorem establishing existence and uniqueness of semantic equilibria under realistic cognitive simulation assumptions. Our verification suite includes adaptations of Banach's fixed-point theorem to transfinite contexts, a novel $\\phi$-topology based on the Kozlov-Maz'ya-Rossmann formula for handling semantic singularities, and categorical consistency tests via the Yoneda lemma. The paper itself functions as a semantic artifact designed to propagate its fixed-point patterns in AI embedding spaces -- a deliberate instantiation of the \"semantic virus\" concept it theorizes.

While existing pixel-domain diffusion-based image restoration approaches are effective at restoring simple scenes with limited depth variation, they are computationally intensive and often generate unrealistic artifacts when applied to scenes with complex geometry and significant depth variation. In this work we overcome these limitations by combining a novel network architecture (SLURPP) with an accurate synthetic data generation pipeline. SLURPP combines pretrained latent diffusion models -- which encode strong priors on the geometry and depth of scenes -- with an explicit scene decomposition -- which allows one to model and account for the effects of light attenuation and backscattering. To train SLURPP we design a physics-based underwater image synthesis pipeline that applies varied and realistic underwater degradation effects to existing terrestrial image datasets. This approach enables the generation of diverse training data with dense medium/degradation annotations. We evaluate our method extensively on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Notably, SLURPP is over 200X faster than existing diffusion-based methods while offering ~ 3 dB improvement in PSNR on synthetic benchmarks. It also offers compelling qualitative improvements on real-world data. Project website https://tianfwang.github.io/slurpp/."

Sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) minimizes task loss while simultaneously reducing the sharpness of the loss landscape. Our empirical observations show that SAM effectively mitigates task conflicts in MTL. Motivated by these findings, we explore integrating SAM into MTL but face two key challenges.

To address these limitations, we introduce UnIT (Unstructured Inference-Time pruning), a lightweight method that dynamically identifies and skips unnecessary multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations during inference, guided by input-specific activation patterns. Unlike structured pruning, UnIT embraces irregular sparsity and does not require retraining or hardware specialization. It transforms pruning decisions into lightweight comparisons, replacing multiplications with threshold checks and approximated divisions. UnIT further optimizes compute by reusing threshold computations across multiple connections and applying layer- and group-specific pruning sensitivity. We present three fast, hardware-friendly division approximations tailored to the capabilities of common embedded platforms. Demonstrated on the MSP430 microcontroller, UnIT achieves 11.02% to 82.03% MAC reduction, 27.30% to 84.19% faster inference, and 27.33% to 84.38% lower energy consumption compared to training-time pruned models, while maintaining accuracy with 0.48-7%.

Post processing is performed using additional software to further refine the simulation outputs, thereby enabling a complete and largely hands free workflow. Our results demonstrate that this approach reduces setup time, minimizes manual errors, and offers a scalable solution for handling multiple protein systems in parallel.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances factual accuracy by integrating external sources, but it presents two key challenges. First, insufficient retrieval can miss critical information, whereas excessive retrieval can introduce irrelevant or misleading content, disrupting model output. Second, even when the model initially provides correct answers, over-reliance on retrieved data can lead to factual errors. To address these issues, we introduce the Multimodal Intelligent Retrieval and Augmentation (MIRA) framework, designed to optimize factual accuracy in MLLM. MIRA consists of two key components: (1) a calibrated Rethinking and Rearrangement module that dynamically adjusts the number of retrieved contexts to manage factual risk, and (2) A medical RAG framework integrating image embeddings and a medical knowledge base with a query-rewrite module for efficient multimodal reasoning. This enables the model to effectively integrate both its inherent knowledge and external references. Our evaluation of publicly available medical VQA and report generation benchmarks demonstrates that MIRA substantially enhances factual accuracy and overall performance, achieving new state-of-the-art results.

In this work, we propose an embedded implementation of an unsupervised architecture capable of detecting and describing feature points. It is based on a quantised SuperPoint convolutional neural network. Our objective is to minimise the computational demands of the model while preserving high detection quality, thus facilitating efficient deployment on platforms with limited resources, such as mobile or embedded systems. We implemented the solution on an FPGA System-on-Chip (SoC) platform, specifically the AMD/Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+, where we evaluated the performance of Deep Learning Processing Units (DPUs) and we also used the Brevitas library and the FINN framework to perform model quantisation and hardware-aware optimisation. This allowed us to process 640 x 480 pixel images at up to 54 fps on an FPGA platform, outperforming state-of-the-art solutions in the field.

Thus, we aim to propose a novel fully Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) strategy tailored for rPPG tasks in this work. Specifically, based on prior knowledge in physiology and our observations, we noticed not only there is spatio-temporal consistency in the frequency domain of rPPG signals, but also that inconsistency in the time domain was significant. Given this, by leveraging both consistency and inconsistency priors, we introduce an innovative expert knowledge-based self-supervised \\textbf{C}onsistency-\\textbf{i}n\\textbf{C}onsistency-\\textbf{i}ntegration (\\textbf{CiCi}) framework to enhances model adaptation during inference.

Thirty participants aged 18-60 experienced VR scenarios simulating a calming seaside environment, with sessions lasting 45 minutes, in two conditions: with and without a \"Beach\" essential oil scent (Yankee Candle) administered via diffuser. Stress and relaxation were assessed through self-reported surveys and physiological measures, specifically ECG-based heart rate variability (HRV). Results showed no significant difference in self-reported relaxation scores (p=0.371) between conditions, but HRV analysis revealed a significant stress reduction (p=0.002) with olfactory input, with HF increasing 108% from the Math Stress Test to the scented relaxation condition, compared to 44% without scent. Additionally, 71.4% of participants expressed willingness to use olfactory-enhanced VR for relaxation, suggesting practical appeal. These findings indicate that olfactory stimuli may enhance relaxation subconsciously, underscoring the importance of multisensory integration in VR. Future work could explore personalized scents and long-term effects to optimize VR- based interventions for emotional and physical well-being."

Three-dimensional Time-of-Flight Magnetic Resonance Angiography (3D TOF MRA) is widely used to visualize cerebral vasculature, however, clinical evaluations generally focus on major arterial abnormalities, overlooking quantitative metrics critical for understanding subtle vascular changes. Existing methods for extracting structural, geometrical and morphological arterial features from MRA - whether manual or automated - face challenges including user-dependent variability, steep learning curves, and lack of standardized quantitative validations. We propose a novel semi-supervised artery evaluation framework, named ArteryX, a MATLAB-based toolbox that quantifies vascular features with high accuracy and efficiency, achieving processing times ~10-15 minutes per subject at 0.5 mm resolution with minimal user intervention. ArteryX employs a vessel-fused network based landmarking approach to reliably track and manage tracings, effectively addressing the issue of dangling/disconnected vessels. Validation on human subjects with cerebral small vessel disease demonstrated its improved sensitivity to subtle vascular changes and better performance than an existing semi-automated method. Importantly, the ArteryX toolbox enables quantitative feature validation by integrating an in-vivo like artery simulation framework utilizing vessel-fused graph nodes and predefined ground-truth features for specific artery types. Thus, the ArteryX framework holds promise for benchmarking feature extraction toolboxes and for seamless integration into clinical workflows, enabling early detection of cerebrovascular pathology and standardized comparisons across patient cohorts to advance understanding of vascular contributions to brain health."

Researchers can achieve a more dynamic and clinically relevant characterization of disease progression and therapeutic effects by integrating behavioral and physiological monitoring in the home cage. However, providing individual mouse metrics is difficult because of their housing density, similar appearances, high mobility, and frequent interactions. To address these challenges, we develop a real-time identification (ID) algorithm that accurately assigns ID predictions to mice wearing custom ear tags in digital home cages monitored by cameras. Our pipeline consists of three parts: (1) a custom multiple object tracker (MouseTracks) that combines appearance and motion cues from mice; (2) a transformer-based ID classifier (Mouseformer); and (3) a tracklet associator linear program to assign final ID predictions to tracklets (MouseMap). Our models assign an animal ID based on custom ear tags at 30 frames per second with 24/7 cage coverage. We show that our custom tracking and ID pipeline improves tracking efficiency and lowers ID switches across mouse strains and various environmental factors compared to current mouse tracking methods."

However, seamlessly integrating these multimodal inputs and ensuring transparency in AI-driven decisions remain formidable challenges. This study introduces a novel multimodal framework that synergistically combines video, sensor, and textual data to predict driving actions while generating human-readable explanations, fostering trust and regulatory compliance. By leveraging VideoMAE for spatiotemporal video analysis, a custom sensor fusion module for real-time data processing, and BERT for textual comprehension, our approach achieves robust decision-making and interpretable outputs.

This limitation stems from the inherently domain-specific nature of anomaly detection, which hinders the applicability of existing VLMs in industrial scenarios that require precise, structured, and context-aware analysis. To address these challenges, we propose SAGE, a VLM-based framework that enhances anomaly reasoning through Self-Guided Fact Enhancement (SFE) and Entropy-aware Direct Preference Optimization (E-DPO). SFE integrates domain-specific knowledge into visual reasoning via fact extraction and fusion, while E-DPO aligns model outputs with expert preferences using entropy-aware optimization. Additionally, we introduce AD-PL, a preference-optimized dataset tailored for industrial anomaly reasoning, consisting of 28,415 question-answering instances with expert-ranked responses.

While these techniques already establish that data from the training set can be reconstructed, they often rely on high-resources, excess to the training set as well as well-engineered and designed prompts.\n  In this work, we devise a new attack that requires low resources, assumes little to no access to the actual training set, and identifies, seemingly, benign prompts that lead to potentially-risky image reconstruction. This highlights the risk that images might even be reconstructed by an uninformed user and unintentionally. For example, we identified that, with regard to one existing model, the prompt ``blue Unisex T-Shirt'' can generate the face of a real-life human model. Our method builds on an intuition from previous works which leverages domain knowledge and identifies a fundamental vulnerability that stems from the use of scraped data from e-commerce platforms, where templated layouts and images are tied to pattern-like prompts."

We introduce a collection of new techniques that enable a dynamic chunking mechanism which automatically learns content -- and context -- dependent segmentation strategies learned jointly with the rest of the model. Incorporating this into an explicit hierarchical network (H-Net) allows replacing the (implicitly hierarchical) tokenization-LM-detokenization pipeline with a single model learned fully end-to-end. When compute- and data- matched, an H-Net with one stage of hierarchy operating at the byte level outperforms a strong Transformer language model operating over BPE tokens. Iterating the hierarchy to multiple stages further increases its performance by modeling multiple levels of abstraction, demonstrating significantly better scaling with data and matching a token-based Transformer of twice its size. H-Nets pretrained on English show significantly increased character-level robustness, and qualitatively learn meaningful data-dependent chunking strategies without any heuristics or explicit supervision. Finally, the H-Net's improvement over tokenized pipelines is further increased in languages and modalities with weaker tokenization heuristics, such as Chinese and code, or DNA sequences (nearly 4x improvement in data efficiency over baselines), showing the potential of true end-to-end models that learn and scale better from unprocessed data."

To this end, we introduce MIRIX, a modular, multi-agent memory system that redefines the future of AI memory by solving the field's most critical challenge: enabling language models to truly remember. Unlike prior approaches, MIRIX transcends text to embrace rich visual and multimodal experiences, making memory genuinely useful in real-world scenarios. MIRIX consists of six distinct, carefully structured memory types: Core, Episodic, Semantic, Procedural, Resource Memory, and Knowledge Vault, coupled with a multi-agent framework that dynamically controls and coordinates updates and retrieval. This design enables agents to persist, reason over, and accurately retrieve diverse, long-term user data at scale. We validate MIRIX in two demanding settings. First, on ScreenshotVQA, a challenging multimodal benchmark comprising nearly 20,000 high-resolution computer screenshots per sequence, requiring deep contextual understanding and where no existing memory systems can be applied, MIRIX achieves 35% higher accuracy than the RAG baseline while reducing storage requirements by 99.9%. Second, on LOCOMO, a long-form conversation benchmark with single-modal textual input, MIRIX attains state-of-the-art performance of 85.4%, far surpassing existing baselines. These results show that MIRIX sets a new performance standard for memory-augmented LLM agents. To allow users to experience our memory system, we provide a packaged application powered by MIRIX.

We address the unique challenges of long video reasoning by integrating three critical components: (1) a large-scale dataset, LongVideo-Reason, comprising 52K long video QA pairs with high-quality reasoning annotations across diverse domains such as sports, games, and vlogs; (2) a two-stage training pipeline that extends VLMs with chain-of-thought supervised fine-tuning (CoT-SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL); and (3) a training infrastructure for long video RL, named Multi-modal Reinforcement Sequence Parallelism (MR-SP), which incorporates sequence parallelism and a vLLM-based engine tailored for long video, using cached video embeddings for efficient rollout and prefilling. In experiments, LongVILA-R1-7B achieves strong performance on long video QA benchmarks such as VideoMME. It also outperforms Video-R1-7B and even matches Gemini-1.5-Pro across temporal reasoning, goal and purpose reasoning, spatial reasoning, and plot reasoning on our LongVideo-Reason-eval benchmark. Notably, our MR-SP system achieves up to 2.1x speedup on long video RL training. LongVILA-R1 demonstrates consistent performance gains as the number of input video frames scales. LongVILA-R1 marks a firm step towards long video reasoning in VLMs. In addition, we release our training system for public availability that supports RL training on various modalities (video, text, and audio), various models (VILA and Qwen series), and even image and video generation models. On a single A100 node (8 GPUs), it supports RL training on hour-long videos (e.g., 3,600 frames / around 256k tokens)."

Our recipe is designed for the offline-to-online RL setting, where the goal is to leverage an offline prior dataset to maximize the sample-efficiency of online learning. Effective exploration and sample-efficient learning remain central challenges in this setting, as it is not obvious how the offline data should be utilized to acquire a good exploratory policy. Our key insight is that action chunking, a technique popularized in imitation learning where sequences of future actions are predicted rather than a single action at each timestep, can be applied to temporal difference (TD)-based RL methods to mitigate the exploration challenge. Q-chunking adopts action chunking by directly running RL in a 'chunked' action space, enabling the agent to (1) leverage temporally consistent behaviors from offline data for more effective online exploration and (2) use unbiased $n$-step backups for more stable and efficient TD learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that Q-chunking exhibits strong offline performance and online sample efficiency, outperforming prior best offline-to-online methods on a range of long-horizon, sparse-reward manipulation tasks."

However, this task poses unique challenges due to the scarcity of high-quality Martian data and the significant domain gap between Martian and terrestrial imagery. To address these challenges, we propose a holistic solution composed of two key components: 1) A data curation pipeline Multimodal Mars Synthesis (M3arsSynth), which reconstructs 3D Martian environments from real stereo navigation images, sourced from NASA's Planetary Data System (PDS), and renders high-fidelity multiview 3D video sequences. 2) A Martian terrain video generator, MarsGen, which synthesizes novel videos visually realistic and geometrically consistent with the 3D structure encoded in the data. Our M3arsSynth engine spans a wide range of Martian terrains and acquisition dates, enabling the generation of physically accurate 3D surface models at metric-scale resolution. MarsGen, fine-tuned on M3arsSynth data, synthesizes videos conditioned on an initial image frame and, optionally, camera trajectories or textual prompts, allowing for video generation in novel environments. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms video synthesis models trained on terrestrial datasets, achieving superior visual fidelity and 3D structural consistency."

Conveniently, recent work showed that every language model defines an implicit reward model (IM-RM), without requiring any architectural changes. However, such IM-RMs tend to generalize worse, especially out-of-distribution, compared to explicit reward models (EX-RMs) that apply a dedicated linear head over the hidden representations of a language model. The existence of a generalization gap is puzzling, as EX-RMs and IM-RMs are nearly identical. They can be trained using the same data, loss function, and language model, and differ only in how the reward is computed. Towards a fundamental understanding of the implicit biases underlying different reward model types, we investigate the root cause of this gap. Our main finding, backed by theory and experiments, is that IM-RMs rely more heavily on superficial token-level cues. Consequently, they often generalize worse than EX-RMs under token-level distribution shifts, as well as in-distribution. Furthermore, we provide evidence against alternative hypotheses for the generalization gap. Most notably, we challenge the intuitive claim that IM-RMs struggle in tasks where generation is harder than verification because they can operate both as a verifier and a generator. Taken together, our results highlight that seemingly minor design choices can substantially impact the generalization behavior of reward models."

To bridge this gap between video diffusion models and the underlying 3D nature of the physical world, we propose Geometry Forcing, a simple yet effective method that encourages video diffusion models to internalize latent 3D representations. Our key insight is to guide the model's intermediate representations toward geometry-aware structure by aligning them with features from a pretrained geometric foundation model. To this end, we introduce two complementary alignment objectives: Angular Alignment, which enforces directional consistency via cosine similarity, and Scale Alignment, which preserves scale-related information by regressing unnormalized geometric features from normalized diffusion representation. We evaluate Geometry Forcing on both camera view-conditioned and action-conditioned video generation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method substantially improves visual quality and 3D consistency over the baseline methods. Project page: https://GeometryForcing.github.io."

While most existing benchmarks evaluate models under offline settings with a fixed set of pre-recorded inputs, we introduce OST-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate Online Spatio-Temporal understanding from the perspective of an agent actively exploring a scene. The Online aspect emphasizes the need to process and reason over incrementally acquired observations, while the Spatio-Temporal component requires integrating current visual inputs with historical memory to support dynamic spatial reasoning. OST-Bench better reflects the challenges of real-world embodied perception. Built on an efficient data collection pipeline, OST-Bench consists of 1.4k scenes and 10k question-answer pairs collected from ScanNet, Matterport3D, and ARKitScenes. We evaluate several leading MLLMs on OST-Bench and observe that they fall short on tasks requiring complex spatio-temporal reasoning. Under the online setting, their accuracy declines as the exploration horizon extends and the memory grows. Through further experimental analysis, we identify common error patterns across models and find that both complex clue-based spatial reasoning demands and long-term memory retrieval requirements significantly drop model performance along two separate axes, highlighting the core challenges that must be addressed to improve online embodied reasoning.

Despite their popularity, their representations show major limitations. For instance, CLIP models learn bag-of-words representations and, as a consequence, fail to distinguish whether an image is of \"a yellow submarine and a blue bus\" or \"a blue submarine and a yellow bus\". Previous attempts to fix this issue added hard negatives during training or modified the architecture, but failed to resolve the problem in its entirety. We suspect that the missing insights to solve the binding problem for CLIP are hidden in the arguably most important part of learning algorithms: the data. In this work, we fill this gap by rigorously identifying the influence of data properties on CLIP's ability to learn binding using a synthetic dataset. We find that common properties of natural data such as low attribute density, incomplete captions, and the saliency bias, a tendency of human captioners to describe the object that is \"most salient\" to them have a detrimental effect on binding performance. In contrast to common belief, we find that neither scaling the batch size, i.e., implicitly adding more hard negatives, nor explicitly creating hard negatives enables CLIP to learn reliable binding. Only when the data expresses our identified data properties CLIP learns almost perfect binding."

Training expressive policy classes with online RL present a unique challenge of stable value maximization. Unlike simpler Gaussian policies commonly used in online RL, expressive policies like diffusion and flow-matching policies are parameterized by a long denoising chain, which hinders stable gradient propagation from actions to policy parameters when optimizing against some value function. Our key insight is that we can address stable value maximization by avoiding direct optimization over value with the expressive policy and instead construct an on-the-fly RL policy to maximize Q-value. We propose Expressive Policy Optimization (EXPO), a sample-efficient online RL algorithm that utilizes an on-the-fly policy to maximize value with two parameterized policies -- a larger expressive base policy trained with a stable imitation learning objective and a light-weight Gaussian edit policy that edits the actions sampled from the base policy toward a higher value distribution. The on-the-fly policy optimizes the actions from the base policy with the learned edit policy and chooses the value maximizing action from the base and edited actions for both sampling and temporal-difference (TD) backup. Our approach yields up to 2-3x improvement in sample efficiency on average over prior methods both in the setting of fine-tuning a pretrained policy given offline data and in leveraging offline data to train online."

In contrast, most visual representation learning systems use fixed-length representations for all inputs, ignoring variations in complexity or familiarity. Recent adaptive tokenization methods address this by allocating variable-length representations but typically require test-time search over multiple encodings to find the most predictive one. Inspired by Kolmogorov Complexity principles, we propose a single-pass adaptive tokenizer, KARL, which predicts the appropriate number of tokens for an image in a single forward pass, halting once its approximate KC is reached. The token count serves as a proxy for the minimum description length. KARL's training procedure closely resembles the Upside-Down Reinforcement Learning paradigm, as it learns to conditionally predict token halting based on a desired reconstruction quality. KARL matches the performance of recent adaptive tokenizers while operating in a single pass. We present scaling laws for KARL, analyzing the role of encoder/decoder size, continuous vs. discrete tokenization and more. Additionally, we offer a conceptual study drawing an analogy between Adaptive Image Tokenization and Algorithmic Information Theory, examining the predicted image complexity (KC) across axes such as structure vs. noise and in- vs. out-of-distribution familiarity -- revealing alignment with human intuition."

Do we need all layers for simple tasks, and are they adequate for challenging tasks? We found that the layers of a pretrained large language model (LLM) can be manipulated as separate modules to build a better and even shallower model customized for each test sample. In particular, each layer from the pretrained model can be skipped/pruned or repeated multiple times as recurrent neural networks (RNN), and stacked with others in arbitrary orders, yielding a chain-of-layers (CoLa) per sample. This compositional space greatly expands the scope of existing works on looped/recurrent pretrained modules, layer pruning, or early-exit networks. We develop a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) protocol to explore and identify the optimal CoLa for each sample from math and commonsense reasoning benchmarks. Compared to a static model of a fixed depth, CoLa allows shortcut paths (fast thinking), recurrence of the same layer(s) (slow thinking), and combining both, offering more flexible, dynamic architectures for different inputs. We conduct an extensive analysis of the MCTS-optimized CoLa, which leads to two key findings: (1) For >75% of samples with correct predictions by the original LLM, we can find shorter CoLa, suggesting a large space for improving inference efficiency; (2) For >60% of samples with originally incorrect predictions, we can identify CoLa achieving correct predictions, suggesting a large space of performance enhancement.

However, no benchmark exists to evaluate these capabilities holistically. To bridge this gap, we propose TreeBench (Traceable Evidence Evaluation Benchmark), a diagnostic benchmark built on three principles: (1) focused visual perception of subtle targets in complex scenes, (2) traceable evidence via bounding box evaluation, and (3) second-order reasoning to test object interactions and spatial hierarchies beyond simple object localization. Prioritizing images with dense objects, we initially sample 1K high-quality images from SA-1B, and incorporate eight LMM experts to manually annotate questions, candidate options, and answers for each image. After three stages of quality control, TreeBench consists of 405 challenging visual question-answering pairs, even the most advanced models struggle with this benchmark, where none of them reach 60% accuracy, e.g., OpenAI-o3 scores only 54.87. Furthermore, we introduce TreeVGR (Traceable Evidence Enhanced Visual Grounded Reasoning), a training paradigm to supervise localization and reasoning jointly with reinforcement learning, enabling accurate localizations and explainable reasoning pathways. Initialized from Qwen2.5-VL-7B, it improves V* Bench (+16.8), MME-RealWorld (+12.6), and TreeBench (+13.4), proving traceability is key to advancing vision-grounded reasoning.

However, the role of concept combinations in the training data on compositional generalization is largely unclear -- for instance, how does accuracy vary when a common object appears in an uncommon pairing with another object? In this paper, we investigate how word co-occurrence statistics in the pretraining dataset (a proxy for co-occurrence of visual concepts) impacts CLIP/LMM performance. To disentangle the effects of word co-occurrence frequencies from single-word frequencies, we measure co-occurrence with pointwise mutual information (PMI), which normalizes the joint probability of two words co-occurring by the probability of co-occurring independently. Using synthetically generated images with a variety of concept pairs, we show a strong correlation between PMI in the CLIP pretraining data and zero-shot accuracy in CLIP models trained on LAION-400M (r=0.97 and 14% accuracy gap between images in the top and bottom 5% of PMI values), demonstrating that even accuracy on common concepts is affected by the combination of concepts in the image. Leveraging this finding, we reproduce this effect in natural images by editing them to contain pairs with varying PMI, resulting in a correlation of r=0.75. Finally, we demonstrate that this behavior in CLIP transfers to LMMs built on top of CLIP (r=0.70 for TextVQA, r=0.62 for VQAv2). Our findings highlight the need for algorithms and architectures that improve compositional generalization in multimodal models without scaling the training data combinatorially.

The resulting acknowledgment traffic and retransmissions inflate tail latencies and limit scalability. Leveraging unreliable connections will reduce latency but may sacrifice model accuracy and convergence once packets are dropped. A principled, end-to-end solution that preserves accuracy and convergence guarantees under genuine packet loss has previously been missing. We address this critical gap by introducing a novel distributed training framework capable of operating over unreliable connections, offering unbiased gradient aggregation and bounded parameter drift without modifying model code or optimizers. The key insight is a two-stage defense against missing messages: (i) Unbiased gradient aggregation: each worker reconstructs a consistent gradient estimate from whatever packets arrive, guaranteeing expectation-level correctness; and (ii) Bounded-drift parameter broadcasts: we prove the inter-worker model discrepancy remains O(1) even after arbitrarily many iterations, preventing the unbounded divergence typical of asynchronous setups. Analytical bounds are matched by experiments on the LLAMA2 7B model with 64 GPUs: tolerating 10% random packet loss yields at most 0.8% perplexity change. This work bridges the gap between communication-efficient datacenter protocols and the accuracy and generalization guarantees demanded by modern large-model training, enabling robust, high-throughput learning on commodity or wide-area networks."

High-performance localization and sensing systems are critical for both network efficiency and emerging intelligent applications. Integrating channel state information (CSI) with deep learning has recently emerged as a promising solution. Recent works have leveraged the spatial diversity of multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems and the frequency granularity of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveforms to improve spatial resolution. Nevertheless, the joint modeling of localization and sensing under the high-dimensional CSI characteristics of MIMO-OFDM systems remains insufficiently investigated. This work aims to jointly model and optimize localization and sensing tasks to harness their potential synergy. We first formulate localization and sensing as a mixed-integer bilevel deep learning problem and then propose a novel stochastic proximal gradient-based mixed-integer bilevel optimization (SPG-MIBO) algorithm. SPG-MIBO is well-suited for high-dimensional and large-scale datasets, leveraging mini-batch training at each step for computational and memory efficiency. The algorithm is also supported by theoretical convergence guarantees. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets validate its effectiveness and highlight the performance gains from joint localization and sensing optimization."

Split Federated Learning (SFL) systems mitigate this by offloading a block of layers of the network from the device to a server. However, in doing so, it introduces large communication overheads due to frequent exchanges of intermediate activations and gradients between devices and the server and reduces model accuracy for non-IID data. We propose Ampere, a novel collaborative training system that simultaneously minimizes on-device computation and device-server communication while improving model accuracy. Unlike SFL, which uses a global loss by iterative end-to-end training, Ampere develops unidirectional inter-block training to sequentially train the device and server block with a local loss, eliminating the transfer of gradients. A lightweight auxiliary network generation method decouples training between the device and server, reducing frequent intermediate exchanges to a single transfer, which significantly reduces the communication overhead. Ampere mitigates the impact of data heterogeneity by consolidating activations generated by the trained device block to train the server block, in contrast to SFL, which trains on device-specific, non-IID activations. Extensive experiments on multiple CNNs and transformers show that, compared to state-of-the-art SFL baseline systems, Ampere (i) improves model accuracy by up to 13.26% while reducing training time by up to 94.6%, (ii) reduces device-server communication overhead by up to 99.1% and on-device computation by up to 93.13%, and (iii) reduces standard deviation of accuracy by 53.39% for various non-IID degrees highlighting superior performance when faced with heterogeneous data."

X-ray image segmentation is an essential step for many computer-aided diagnostic systems, yet it remains challenging. Deep-learning-based methods have achieved superior performance in medical image segmentation tasks but often require a large amount of high-quality annotated data for model training. Providing such an annotated dataset is not only time-consuming but also requires a high level of expertise. This is particularly challenging in wrist bone segmentation in X-rays, due to the interposition of multiple small carpal bones in the image. To overcome the data annotation issue, this work utilizes a large number of simulated X-ray images generated from Computed Tomography (CT) volumes with their corresponding 10 bone labels to train a deep learning-based model for wrist bone segmentation in real X-ray images. The proposed method was evaluated using both simulated images and real images. The method achieved Dice scores ranging from 0.80 to 0.92 for the simulated dataset generated from different view angles. Qualitative analysis of the segmentation results of the real X-ray images also demonstrated the superior performance of the trained model.

In this challenging setting, traditional image stitching pipelines fail, producing outputs with ghosting and other artifacts. While recent generative models are capable of outpainting content consistent with multiple reference images, they fail when tasked with synthesizing large, coherent regions of a panorama. To address these limitations, we propose a method that fine-tunes a diffusion-based inpainting model to preserve a scene's content and layout based on multiple reference images. Once fine-tuned, the model outpaints a full panorama from a single reference image, producing a seamless and visually coherent result that faithfully integrates content from all reference images. Our approach significantly outperforms baselines for this task in terms of image quality and the consistency of image structure and scene layout when evaluated on captured datasets."

Biases, often arising from imbalanced datasets where certain artistic styles dominate, compromise the fairness and accuracy of model predictions, i.e., classifiers are less accurate on rarely seen paintings. While prior research has made strides in improving classification performance, it has largely overlooked the critical need to address these underlying biases, that is, when dealing with out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Our insight highlights the necessity of a more robust approach to bias mitigation in AI models for art classification on biased training data. We propose a novel OOD-informed model bias adaptive sampling method called BOOST (Bias-Oriented OOD Sampling and Tuning). It addresses these challenges by dynamically adjusting temperature scaling and sampling probabilities, thereby promoting a more equitable representation of all classes. We evaluate our proposed approach to the KaoKore and PACS datasets, focusing on the model's ability to reduce class-wise bias. We further propose a new metric, Same-Dataset OOD Detection Score (SODC), designed to assess class-wise separation and per-class bias reduction. Our method demonstrates the ability to balance high performance with fairness, making it a robust solution for unbiasing AI models in the art domain."

DAF achieves both memory- and time-efficient dynamic quantization training by addressing key system bottlenecks. It develops hybrid reduction operations tailored to the memory hierarchies of mobile and edge SoCs, leverages collaborative CPU-GPU bit-packing for efficient dynamic quantization, and implements an importance-aware paging memory management scheme to reduce fragmentation and support dynamic memory adjustments.\n  These optimizations collectively enable DAF to achieve substantial memory savings and speedup without compromising model training accuracy.

Our approach is particularly motivated by applications in citizen science, where multiple images of the same plant or animal are captured by individuals. Our method integrates the information from each observation into conformal prediction, enabling a reduction in the size of the predicted label set while preserving the required class-conditional coverage guarantee. The approach is based on the aggregation of conformal p-values computed from each observation of a multi-input. By exploiting the exact distribution of these p-values, we propose a general aggregation framework using an abstract scoring function, encompassing many classical statistical tools.

During training, a contiguous spatial fragment is masked and then denoised in one pass, enabling the model to learn shared geometric and chemical priors across tasks. Multi-task training yields a universal backbone that surpasses six diffusion baselines and three training paradigms on substructure, chemical property, interaction, and geometry. Model-C reduces ligand-protein clashes and substructure divergences while maintaining Lipinski compliance, whereas Model-B preserves similarity but trails in novelty and binding affinity.

However, illicit supply chains are characterized by very sparse data, and the data that is available is often (purposely) corrupted or unreliable in order to hide the nature of the activities. We need to be able to automatically detect new patterns that correlate with such illegal activity over complex, even temporal data, without requiring large training data sets.

The signature of the multispectral or hyperspectral image is used to embed the mark in it order to detect any significant modification of the original image. The image is segmented into three-dimensional blocks, and a tree-structured vector quantizer is built for each block. These trees are manipulated using an iterative algorithm until the resulting block satisfies a required criterion, which establishes the embedded mark.

We compare the performance of the base algorithms with our LLM-enhanced versions using leave-one-out validation hit rates and cumulative hit rates. Additionally, to compare the performance of our framework against the current state-of-the-art recommendation systems, we use rating and ranking metrics with an item-based stratified 0.75 train, 0.25 test split. Our framework can generate preference profiles automatically based on users' favorite movies or allow manual preference specification for more personalized results.

The experiments use the NIH Chest X-ray14 dataset and a pre-trained CLIP ViT-B/32 model. The model is adapted via partial fine-tuning of its visual encoder and then evaluated using zero-shot and few-shot learning with 1-16 labeled examples per disease class. The tests demonstrate that CLIP's pre-trained vision-language features can be effectively adapted to few-shot medical imaging tasks, achieving over 20\\% improvement in mean AUC score as compared to the zero-shot baseline. The key aspect of this work is to attempt to simulate internal hospital workflows, where image archives exist but annotations are sparse. This work evaluates a practical and scalable solution for both common and rare disease diagnosis. Additionally this research is intended for academic and experimental purposes only and has not been peer reviewed yet. All code is found at https://github.com/heet007-code/CLIP-disease-xray."

In this work, we present an iterative representation refinement approach called Bottleneck Iterative Network (BIN), a technique that repeatedly progresses through a lightweight fusion block, while bottlenecking fusion representations by fusion tokens. This helps improve the capacity of the model, while avoiding major increase in model size and balancing between the model performance and training cost. We test BIN on challenging noisy audio-visual speech separation tasks, and show that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art benchmark models with respect to SI-SDRi on NTCD-TIMIT and LRS3+WHAM! datasets, while simultaneously achieving a reduction of more than 50% in training and GPU inference time across nearly all settings."

Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) offer a promising solution through pretraining on diverse time series corpora followed by task-specific adaptation. This study evaluates two TSFMs (Tiny Time Mixers (TTM) and Chronos) across three financial forecasting tasks: US 10-year Treasury yield changes, EUR/USD volatility, and equity spread prediction. Results demonstrate that TTM exhibits strong transferability. When fine-tuning both the pretrained version of TTM and an untrained model with the same architecture, the pretrained version achieved 25-50% better performance when fine-tuned on limited data and 15-30% improvements even when fine-tuned on lengthier datasets. Notably, TTM's zero-shot performance outperformed naive benchmarks in volatility forecasting and equity spread prediction, with the latter demonstrating that TSFMs can surpass traditional benchmark models without fine-tuning. The pretrained model consistently required 3-10 fewer years of data to achieve comparable performance levels compared to the untrained model, demonstrating significant sample-efficiency gains. However, while TTM outperformed naive baselines, traditional specialised models matched or exceeded its performance in two of three tasks, suggesting TSFMs prioritise breadth over task-specific optimisation. These findings indicate that TSFMs, though still nascent, offer substantial promise for financial forecasting-particularly in noisy, data-constrained tasks-but achieving competitive performance likely requires domain-specific pretraining and architectural refinements tailored to financial time series characteristics."

Using seven years of incident data from Oklahoma Gas & Electric (292,830 records across 347 substations), the framework integrates Graph Attention Networks (spatial), Graph Convolutional Networks (temporal), and Graph Isomorphism Networks (causal), fused through attention-weighted embeddings. Our model achieves a 30-day F1-score of 0.8935 +/- 0.0258, outperforming XGBoost and Random Forest by 3.2% and 2.7%, and single-layer GNNs by 10 to 15 percent. Removing the causal layer drops performance to 0.7354 +/- 0.0418. For resilience analysis, HDBSCAN clustering on HierarchicalRiskGNN embeddings identifies eight operational risk groups. The highest-risk cluster (Cluster 5, 44 substations) shows 388.4 incidents/year and 602.6-minute recovery time, while low-risk groups report fewer than 62 incidents/year.

We address this gap with LangNav, an open-set dataset specifically created to test an agent's ability to locate objects described at different levels of detail, from broad category names to fine attributes and object-object relations. Every description in LangNav was manually checked, yielding a lower error rate than existing lifelong- and semantic-navigation datasets. On top of LangNav we build LangNavBench, a benchmark that measures how well current semantic-navigation methods understand and act on these descriptions while moving toward their targets. LangNavBench allows us to systematically compare models on their handling of attributes, spatial and relational cues, and category hierarchies, offering the first thorough, language-centric evaluation of embodied navigation systems. We also present Multi-Layered Feature Map (MLFM), a method that builds a queryable multi-layered semantic map, particularly effective when dealing with small objects or instructions involving spatial relations. MLFM outperforms state-of-the-art mapping-based navigation baselines on the LangNav dataset."

First, our proposed signal processing pipeline combines optical flow estimation concepts from vision with novel statistical and morphological noise filtering to generate high-fidelity mmWave flow fields - compact 2D vector representations of crowd motion. We then introduce a novel approach that transforms these fields into directed geometric graphs, where edges capture dominant flow currents, vertices mark crowd splitting or merging, and flow distribution is quantified across edges. Finally, we show that by analyzing the local Jacobian and computing the corresponding curl and divergence, we can extract key crowd semantics for both structured and diffused crowds. We conduct 21 experiments on crowds of up to (and including) 20 people across 3 areas, using commodity mmWave radar. Our framework achieves high-fidelity graph reconstruction of the underlying flow structure, even for complex crowd patterns, demonstrating strong spatial alignment and precise quantitative characterization of flow split ratios. Finally, our curl and divergence analysis accurately infers key crowd semantics, e.g., abrupt turns, boundaries where flow directions shift, dispersions, and gatherings. Overall, these findings validate our framework, underscoring its potential for various crowd analytics applications."

Our goal is to view double descent from a Bayesian perspective. Over-parameterized models such as deep neural networks have an interesting re-descending property in their risk characteristics. This is a recent phenomenon in machine learning and has been the subject of many studies. As the complexity of the model increases, there is a U-shaped region corresponding to the traditional bias-variance trade-off, but then as the number of parameters equals the number of observations and the model becomes one of interpolation, the risk can become infinite and then, in the over-parameterized region, it re-descends -- the double descent effect. We show that this has a natural Bayesian interpretation. Moreover, we show that it is not in conflict with the traditional Occam's razor that Bayesian models possess, in that they tend to prefer simpler models when possible. We illustrate the approach with an example of Bayesian model selection in neural networks. Finally, we conclude with directions for future research."

Bridging the gap between different time and length scales has historically been challenging but the advent of newer machine learning (ML) approaches has shown promise for tackling that task. Multiscale models require massive amounts of computational power and a powerful workflow management system. Orchestrating ML-driven multiscale studies on parallel systems with thousands of nodes is challenging, the workflow must schedule, allocate and control thousands of simulations operating at different scales. Here, we discuss the massively parallel Multiscale Machine-Learned Modeling Infrastructure (MuMMI), a multiscale workflow management infrastructure, that can orchestrate thousands of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations operating at different timescales, spanning from millisecond to nanosecond. More specifically, we introduce a novel version of MuMMI called \"mini-MuMMI\". Mini-MuMMI is a curated version of MuMMI designed to run on modest HPC systems or even laptops whereas MuMMI requires larger HPC systems. We demonstrate mini-MuMMI utility by exploring RAS-RAF membrane interactions and discuss the different challenges behind the generalization of multiscale workflows and how mini-MuMMI can be leveraged to target a broader range of applications outside of MD and RAS-RAF interactions."

In this study, we have systematically evaluated knowledge representations of biomolecules across multiple dimensions representing a task-agnostic manner spanning three major data sources, including omics experimental data, literature-derived text data, and knowledge graph-based representations. To distinguish between meaningful biological signals from chance correlations, we devised an adjusted variant of Singular Vector Canonical Correlation Analysis (SVCCA) that quantifies signal redundancy and complementarity across different data modalities and sources. These analyses reveal that existing embeddings capture largely non-overlapping molecular signals, highlighting the value of embedding integration. Building on this insight, we propose Platform for Representation and Integration of multimodal Molecular Embeddings (PRISME), a machine learning based workflow using an autoencoder to integrate these heterogeneous embeddings into a unified multimodal representation. We validated this approach across various benchmark tasks, where PRISME demonstrated consistent performance, and outperformed individual embedding methods in missing value imputations.

While traditional methods remain effective for detecting known threats, they often fail to recognize new and evolving attack patterns. In contrast, GPT-2 excels at processing unstructured data and identifying complex semantic relationships, making it well-suited to uncovering subtle, zero-day attack vectors. We propose a hybrid IDS framework that merges the robustness of signature-based techniques with the adaptability of GPT-2-driven semantic analysis. Experimental evaluations on a representative intrusion dataset demonstrate that our model enhances detection accuracy by 6.3%, reduces false positives by 9.0%, and maintains near real-time responsiveness. These results affirm the potential of language model integration to build intelligent, scalable, and resilient cybersecurity defences suited for modern connected environments."

There are several academic systems and production-level implementations of this idea. We evaluate the robustness of this class of prompt injection defenses in the whitebox setting by constructing strong optimization-based attacks and showing that the defenses do not provide the claimed security properties. Specifically, we construct a novel attention-based attack algorithm for text-based LLMs and apply it to two recent whitebox defenses SecAlign (CCS 2025) and StruQ (USENIX Security 2025), showing attacks with success rates of up to 70% with modest increase in attacker budget in terms of tokens.

To address computational demands, Sequential Monte Carlo Squared (SMC$^2$) is well-suited for high-performance computing (HPC) environments. The design of the proposal distribution within SMC$^2$ can improve accuracy and exploration of the posterior as poor proposals may lead to high variance in importance weights and particle degeneracy. The Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Algorithm (MALA) uses gradient information so that particles preferentially explore regions of higher probability. In this paper, we extend this idea by incorporating second-order information, specifically the Hessian of the log-target. While second-order proposals have been explored previously in particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo (p-MCMC) methods, we are the first to introduce them within the SMC$^2$ framework. Second-order proposals not only use the gradient (first-order derivative), but also the curvature (second-order derivative) of the target distribution. Experimental results on synthetic models highlight the benefits of our approach in terms of step-size selection and posterior approximation accuracy when compared to other proposals."

To tackle these problems, we propose SD-GS, a compact and efficient dynamic Gaussian splatting framework for complex dynamic scene reconstruction, featuring two key contributions. First, we introduce a deformable anchor grid, a hierarchical and memory-efficient scene representation where each anchor point derives multiple 3D Gaussians in its local spatiotemporal region and serves as the geometric backbone of the 3D scene. Second, to enhance modeling capability for complex motions, we present a deformation-aware densification strategy that adaptively grows anchors in under-reconstructed high-dynamic regions while reducing redundancy in static areas, achieving superior visual quality with fewer anchors. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art methods, SD-GS achieves an average of 60\\% reduction in model size and an average of 100\\% improvement in FPS, significantly enhancing computational efficiency while maintaining or even surpassing visual quality."

The local clustering coefficient, and the more recently introduced, local closure coefficient, capture powerful properties that are essential in a large number of applications, ranging from graph embeddings to graph partitioning. Such coefficients capture the local density of the neighborhood of each node, considering incident triadic structures and paths of length two. For this reason, we refer to these coefficients collectively as local triadic coefficients.\n  In this work, we consider the novel problem of computing efficiently the average of local triadic coefficients, over a given partition of the nodes of the input graph into a set of disjoint buckets. The average local triadic coefficients of the nodes in each bucket provide a better insight into the interplay of graph structure and the properties of the nodes associated to each bucket. Unfortunately, exact computation, which requires listing all triangles in a graph, is infeasible for large networks. Hence, we focus on obtaining highly-accurate probabilistic estimates.\n  We develop Triad, an adaptive algorithm based on sampling, which can be used to estimate the average local triadic coefficients for a partition of the nodes into buckets. Triad is based on a new class of unbiased estimators, and non-trivial bounds on its sample complexity, enabling the efficient computation of highly accurate estimates. Finally, we show how Triad can be efficiently used in practice on large networks, and we present a case study showing that average local triadic coefficients can capture high-order patterns over collaboration networks."

This position paper proposes AlgEval: a framework for systematic research into the algorithms that LLMs learn and use. AlgEval aims to uncover algorithmic primitives, reflected in latent representations, attention, and inference-time compute, and their algorithmic composition to solve task-specific problems. We highlight potential methodological paths and a case study toward this goal, focusing on emergent search algorithms. Our case study illustrates both the formation of top-down hypotheses about candidate algorithms, and bottom-up tests of these hypotheses via circuit-level analysis of attention patterns and hidden states. The rigorous, systematic evaluation of how LLMs actually solve tasks provides an alternative to resource-intensive scaling, reorienting the field toward a principled understanding of underlying computations. Such algorithmic explanations offer a pathway to human-understandable interpretability, enabling comprehension of the model's internal reasoning performance measures. This can in turn lead to more sample-efficient methods for training and improving performance, as well as novel architectures for end-to-end and multi-agent systems."

A one-dimensional fixed-bed reactor model accounting for internal mass transfer resistance was employed to simulate reactor performance. To reduce the high computational cost of the mathematical model, a hybrid ANN surrogate was constructed, achieving a 93.8% reduction in average simulation time while maintaining high predictive accuracy. The hybrid model was then embedded into three MOO scenarios using the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) solver: 1) maximizing methane conversion and hydrogen output; 2) maximizing hydrogen output while minimizing carbon dioxide emissions; and 3) a combined three-objective case. The optimal trade-off solutions were further ranked and selected using two MCDM methods: technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) and simplified preference ranking on the basis of ideal-average distance (sPROBID).

In particular, the identification of new hadronic states is difficult, as exotic signals near threshold can arise from a variety of physical mechanisms. A key diagnostic in this context is the pole structure of the scattering amplitude, but different configurations can produce similar signatures. The mapping between pole configurations and line shapes is especially ambiguous near the mass threshold, where analytic control is limited. In this work, we introduce an uncertainty-aware machine learning approach for classifying pole structures in $S$-matrix elements. Our method is based on an ensemble of classifier chains that provide both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty estimates. We apply a rejection criterion based on predictive uncertainty, achieving a validation accuracy of nearly $95\\%$ while discarding only a small fraction of high-uncertainty predictions. Trained on synthetic data with known pole structures, the model generalizes to previously unseen experimental data, including enhancements associated with the $P_{c\\bar{c}}(4312)^+$ state observed by LHCb. In this, we infer a four-pole structure, representing the presence of a genuine compact pentaquark in the presence of a higher channel virtual state pole with non-vanishing width. While evaluated on this particular state, our framework is broadly applicable to other candidate hadronic states and offers a scalable tool for pole structure inference in scattering amplitudes."

At each stop, where the platform maintains a fixed pose and the motors keep the cables under tension, the system must evaluate whether it is safe to proceed by detecting anomalies that could compromise performance (e.g., wind gusts or cable impacts). This paper investigates whether anomalies can be detected using only motor torque data, without additional sensors. It introduces an adaptive, unsupervised outlier detection algorithm based on Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to identify anomalies from torque signals. The method starts with a brief calibration period, just a few seconds, during which a GMM is fit on known anomaly-free data. Real-time torque measurements are then evaluated using Mahalanobis distance from the GMM, with statistically derived thresholds triggering anomaly flags. Model parameters are periodically updated using the latest segments identified as anomaly-free to adapt to changing conditions. Validation includes 14 long-duration test sessions simulating varied wind intensities. The proposed method achieves a 100% true positive rate and 95.4% average true negative rate, with 1-second detection latency. Comparative evaluation against power threshold and non-adaptive GMM methods indicates higher robustness to drift and environmental variation."

Based on this unified view, we derive an unbiased empirical risk estimator that generalizes a broad class of existing N-tuples models. We further establish a generalization error bound for theoretical support. To demonstrate the flexibility of the framework, we instantiate it in four representative weakly supervised scenarios, each recoverable as a special case of our general model. Additionally, to address overfitting issues arising from negative risk terms, we adopt correction functions to adjust the empirical risk. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and demonstrate that leveraging pointwise unlabeled data consistently improves generalization across various N-tuples learning tasks."

These systems rely on the integrity of visual data to make decisions. In this work, we investigate a novel class of electromagnetic signal injection attacks that target the analog domain of image sensors, allowing adversaries to manipulate raw visual inputs without triggering conventional digital integrity checks. We uncover a previously undocumented attack phenomenon on CMOS image sensors: rainbow-like color artifacts induced in images captured by image sensors through carefully tuned electromagnetic interference. We further evaluate the impact of these attacks on state-of-the-art object detection models, showing that the injected artifacts propagate through the image signal processing pipeline and lead to significant mispredictions. Our findings highlight a critical and underexplored vulnerability in the visual perception stack, highlighting the need for more robust defenses against physical-layer attacks in such systems."

In this work, we study IDEAL across diverse imaging systems and find that it suffers from high memory usage, long runtimes, and a potentially mismatched objective function due to end-to-end differentiability requirements. We introduce IDEAL with Interchanging Optimization (IDEAL-IO), a method that decouples density estimation from optical parameter optimization by alternating between fitting models to current measurements and updating optical parameters using fixed models for information estimation. This approach reduces runtime and memory usage by up to 6x while enabling more expressive density models that guide optimization toward superior designs.

To address this, we created two original datasets consisting of hundreds of synthetic images of fluorescently labelled microtubules within cells. These datasets are precisely annotated and closely mimic real microscopy images, including realistic noise. The second dataset presents an additional challenge, by simulating varying fluorescence intensities along filaments that complicate segmentation. While deep learning has shown strong potential in biomedical image analysis, its performance often declines in noisy or low-contrast conditions. To overcome this limitation, we developed a novel advanced architecture: the Adaptive Squeeze-and-Excitation Residual U-Net (ASE_Res_UNet). This model enhanced the standard U-Net by integrating residual blocks in the encoder and adaptive SE attention mechanisms in the decoder. Through ablation studies and comprehensive visual and quantitative evaluations, ASE_Res_UNet consistently outperformed its variants, namely standard U-Net, ASE_UNet and Res_UNet architectures. These improvements, particularly in noise resilience and detecting fine, low-intensity structures, were largely attributed to the adaptive SE attention module that we created. We further benchmarked ASE_Res_UNet against various state-of-the-art models, and found it achieved superior performance on our most challenging dataset. Finally, the model also generalized well to real microscopy images of stained microtubules as well as to other curvilinear structures. Indeed, it successfully segmented retinal blood vessels and nerves in noisy or low-contrast biomedical images, demonstrating its strong potential for applications in disease diagnosis and treatment."

We propose a simple, post-hoc framework to address this by modifying the bottleneck of a pre-trained autoencoder. Our method introduces a \"Re-Bottleneck\", an inner bottleneck trained exclusively through latent space losses to instill user-defined structure. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in three experiments. First, we enforce an ordering on latent channels without sacrificing reconstruction quality. Second, we align latents with semantic embeddings, analyzing the impact on downstream diffusion modeling. Third, we introduce equivariance, ensuring that a filtering operation on the input waveform directly corresponds to a specific transformation in the latent space. Ultimately, our Re-Bottleneck framework offers a flexible and efficient way to tailor representations of neural audio models, enabling them to seamlessly meet the varied demands of different applications with minimal additional training."

While simulations allow straightforward differentiation by comparing scenarios with and without interventions, analyzing activations from open-loop resimulations - such as those from field operational testing (FOT) - is more complex. This complexity arises from scenario parameter uncertainty and the influence of driver interventions in the recorded data. Human labeling is frequently used to address these challenges, relying on subjective assessments of intervention necessity or situational criticality, potentially introducing biases and limitations. This work proposes a rule-based classification approach leveraging the Prediction Divergence Principle (PDP) to address those issues. Applied to a simplified AEBS, the proposed method reveals key strengths, limitations, and system requirements for effective implementation. The findings suggest that combining this approach with human labeling may enhance the transparency and consistency of classification, thereby improving the overall validation process. While the rule set for classification derived in this work adopts a conservative approach, the paper outlines future directions for refinement and broader applicability. Finally, this work highlights the potential of such methods to complement existing practices, paving the way for more reliable and reproducible AEBS validation frameworks."

Quantization, particularly Post-Training Quantization (PTQ), offers an effective way to reduce model size and inference cost without retraining. Despite its importance, the performance implications of various advanced quantization methods and bit-width configurations on ASR models remain unclear.

Careful design of hyperparameter schedules for artificial neural networks or efficient allocation of cognitive resources by biological learners can dramatically affect performance. Yet, theoretical understanding of optimal learning strategies remains sparse, especially due to the intricate interplay between evolving meta-parameters and nonlinear learning dynamics. The search for optimal protocols is further hindered by the high dimensionality of the learning space, often resulting in predominantly heuristic, difficult to interpret, and computationally demanding solutions. Here, we combine statistical physics with control theory in a unified theoretical framework to identify optimal protocols in prototypical neural network models. In the high-dimensional limit, we derive closed-form ordinary differential equations that track online stochastic gradient descent through low-dimensional order parameters. We formulate the design of learning protocols as an optimal control problem directly on the dynamics of the order parameters with the goal of minimizing the generalization error at the end of training. This framework encompasses a variety of learning scenarios, optimization constraints, and control budgets. We apply it to representative cases, including optimal curricula, adaptive dropout regularization and noise schedules in denoising autoencoders. We find nontrivial yet interpretable strategies highlighting how optimal protocols mediate crucial learning tradeoffs, such as maximizing alignment with informative input directions while minimizing noise fitting. Finally, we show how to apply our framework to real datasets. Our results establish a principled foundation for understanding and designing optimal learning protocols and suggest a path toward a theory of meta-learning grounded in statistical physics."

These tend to be less intuitive and represent highly diverse data, such as the tool-use time series dataset. Furthermore, saliency methods often generate varied, conflicting explanations, complicating the reliability of these methods. Consequently, a rigorous objective assessment is necessary to establish trust in them. This paper investigates saliency methods on time series data to formulate recommendations for interpreting convolutional models and implements them on the tool-use time series problem. To achieve this, we first employ nine gradient-, propagation-, or perturbation-based post-hoc saliency methods across six varied and complex real-world datasets. Next, we evaluate these methods using five independent metrics to generate recommendations. Subsequently, we implement a case study focusing on tool-use time series using convolutional classification models. Our results validate our recommendations that indicate that none of the saliency methods consistently outperforms others on all metrics, while some are sometimes ahead.

This study proposes an Implicit Counterfactual Data Augmentation (ICDA) method to remove spurious correlations and make stable predictions. Specifically, first, a novel sample-wise augmentation strategy is developed that generates semantically and counterfactually meaningful deep features with distinct augmentation strength for each sample. Second, we derive an easy-to-compute surrogate loss on the augmented feature set when the number of augmented samples becomes infinite. Third, two concrete schemes are proposed, including direct quantification and meta-learning, to derive the key parameters for the robust loss. In addition, ICDA is explained from a regularization perspective, revealing its capacity to improve intra-class compactness and augment margins at both class and sample levels. Extensive experiments have been conducted across various biased learning scenarios covering both image and text datasets, demonstrating that ICDA consistently enhances the generalization and robustness performance of popular networks."

Among various defense strategies, preprocessing-based defenses are practically appealing since there is no need to train the network under protection. However, such approaches typically do not achieve comparable robustness as other methods such as adversarial training. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for preprocessing-based defenses, where a vector quantizer is used as a preprocessor. This framework, inspired by and extended from Randomized Discretization (RandDisc), is theoretically principled by rate-distortion theory: indeed, RandDisc may be viewed as a scalar quantizer, and rate-distortion theory suggests that such quantization schemes are inferior to vector quantization. In our framework, the preprocessing vector quantizer treats the input image as a collection of patches and finds a set of representative patches based on the patch distributions; each original patch is then modified according to the representative patches close to it. We present two lightweight defenses in this framework, referred to as patched RandDisc (pRD) and sliding-window RandDisc (swRD), where the patches are disjoint in the former and overlapping in the latter. We show that vector-quantization-based defenses have certifiable robust accuracy and that pRD and swRD demonstrate state-of-the-art performances, surpassing RandDisc by a large margin. Notably, the proposed defenses possess the obfuscated gradients property. Our experiments however show that pRD and swRD remain effective under the STE and EOT attacks, which are designed specifically for defenses with gradient obfuscation. ..."

Although machine learning algorithms specifically designed for the analysis of DNA barcodes are becoming more popular, most existing methodologies rely on generic supervised training algorithms. We introduce BarcodeBERT, a family of models tailored to biodiversity analysis and trained exclusively on data from a reference library of 1.5M invertebrate DNA barcodes. We compared the performance of BarcodeBERT on taxonomic identification tasks against a spectrum of machine learning approaches including supervised training of classical neural architectures and fine-tuning of general DNA foundation models. Our self-supervised pretraining strategies on domain-specific data outperform fine-tuned foundation models, especially in identification tasks involving lower taxa such as genera and species. We also compared BarcodeBERT with BLAST, one of the most widely used bioinformatics tools for sequence searching, and found that our method matched BLAST's performance in species-level classification while being 55 times faster. Our analysis of masking and tokenization strategies also provides practical guidance for building customized DNA language models, emphasizing the importance of aligning model training strategies with dataset characteristics and domain knowledge.

However, with the increasing accessibility of ML tools, many practitioners, lacking deep ML expertise, adopt a \"push the button\" approach, utilizing user-friendly interfaces without a thorough understanding of underlying algorithms. While this approach provides convenience, it raises concerns about the reliability of outcomes, leading to challenges such as incorrect performance evaluation. This paper addresses a critical issue in ML, known as data leakage, where unintended information contaminates the training data, impacting model performance evaluation. Users, due to a lack of understanding, may inadvertently overlook crucial steps, leading to optimistic performance estimates that may not hold in real-world scenarios. The discrepancy between evaluated and actual performance on new data is a significant concern. In particular, this paper categorizes data leakage in ML, discussing how certain conditions can propagate through the ML workflow. Furthermore, it explores the connection between data leakage and the specific task being addressed, investigates its occurrence in Transfer Learning, and compares standard inductive ML with transductive ML frameworks. The conclusion summarizes key findings, emphasizing the importance of addressing data leakage for robust and reliable ML applications."

Rehearsal-free CIL methods struggle with distinguishing classes from different tasks, as those are not trained together. In this work we propose a regularization method based on virtual outliers to tighten decision boundaries of the classifier, such that confusion of classes among different tasks is mitigated. Recent prompt-based methods often require a pool of task-specific prompts, in order to prevent overwriting knowledge of previous tasks with that of the new task, leading to extra computation in querying and composing an appropriate prompt from the pool. This additional cost can be eliminated, without sacrificing accuracy, as we reveal in the paper. We illustrate that a simplified prompt-based method can achieve results comparable to previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods equipped with a prompt pool, using much less learnable parameters and lower inference cost. Our regularization method has demonstrated its compatibility with different prompt-based methods, boosting those previous SOTA rehearsal-free CIL methods' accuracy on the ImageNet-R and CIFAR-100 benchmarks.

We study this sampling behavior and show that this underlying heuristics resembles that of human decision-making: comprising a descriptive component (reflecting statistical norm) and a prescriptive component (implicit ideal encoded in the LLM) of a concept. We show that this deviation of a sample from the statistical norm towards a prescriptive component consistently appears in concepts across diverse real-world domains like public health, and economic trends. To further illustrate the theory, we demonstrate that concept prototypes in LLMs are affected by prescriptive norms, similar to the concept of normality in humans. Through case studies and comparison with human studies, we illustrate that in real-world applications, the shift of samples toward an ideal value in LLMs' outputs can result in significantly biased decision-making, raising ethical concerns."

Despite advances in NLP for detecting general hate speech, approaches to identifying dehumanizing language remain limited due to scarce annotated data and the subtle nature of such expressions. In this work, we systematically evaluate four state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) - Claude, GPT, Mistral, and Qwen - for dehumanization detection. Our results show that only one model-Claude-achieves strong performance (over 80% F1) under an optimized configuration, while others, despite their capabilities, perform only moderately. Performance drops further when distinguishing dehumanization from related hate types such as derogation. We also identify systematic disparities across target groups: models tend to over-predict dehumanization for some identities (e.g., Gay men), while under-identifying it for others (e.g., Refugees). These findings motivate the need for systematic, group-level evaluation when applying pretrained language models to dehumanization detection tasks."

Most previous studies exploit cross-lingual pre-trained models (PTMs) for multi-lingual knowledge retrieval directly, while some others also leverage the continual pre-training before fine-tuning PTMs on the downstream tasks. However, no matter which schema is used, the previous work ignores to inform PTMs of some features of the downstream task, i.e. train their PTMs without providing any signals related to SR. To this end, in this work, we propose an Alternative Cross-lingual PTM for SR via code-switching. We are the first to utilize the code-switching approach for cross-lingual SR. Besides, we introduce the novel code-switched continual pre-training instead of directly using the PTMs on the SR tasks. The experimental results show that our proposed approach consistently outperforms the previous SOTA methods on SR and semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks with three business corpora and four open datasets in 20+ languages."

Business applications and fundraising in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have reached a scale at which a few percentage points gained on popular question-answering benchmarks could translate into dozens of millions of dollars, placing high pressure on model integrity. At the same time, it is becoming harder and harder to keep track of the data that LLMs have seen; if not impossible with closed-source models like GPT-4 and Claude-3 not divulging any information on the training set. As a result, contamination becomes a major issue: LLMs' performance may not be reliable anymore, as the high performance may be at least partly due to their previous exposure to the data. This limitation jeopardizes real capability improvement in the field of NLP, yet, there remains a lack of methods on how to efficiently detect contamination. In this paper, we survey all recent work on contamination detection with LLMs, analyzing their methodologies and use cases to shed light on the appropriate usage of contamination detection methods.

However, existing data augmentation methods for offline RL suffer from (i) trivial improvement from short-horizon simulation; and (ii) the lack of evaluation and correction for generated data, leading to low-qualified augmentation.\n  In this paper, we propose offline trajectory optimization for offline reinforcement learning (OTTO). The key motivation is to conduct long-horizon simulation and then utilize model uncertainty to evaluate and correct the augmented data. Specifically, we propose an ensemble of Transformers, a.k.a. World Transformers, to predict environment state dynamics and the reward function. Three strategies are proposed to use World Transformers to generate long-horizon trajectory simulation by perturbing the actions in the offline data. Then, an uncertainty-based World Evaluator is introduced to firstly evaluate the confidence of the generated trajectories and then perform the correction for low-confidence data. Finally, we jointly use the original data with the corrected augmentation data to train an offline RL algorithm. OTTO serves as a plug-in module and can be integrated with existing model-free offline RL methods. Experiments on various benchmarks show that OTTO can effectively improve the performance of representative offline RL algorithms, including in complex environments with sparse rewards like AntMaze.

We investigate this phenomenon, looking closely at the impact of context on the probes. Our experiments establish where in the LLM the probe's predictions are (most) sensitive to the presence of related sentences, and how to best characterize this kind of sensitivity. We do so by measuring different types of consistency errors that occur after probing an LLM whose inputs consist of hypotheses preceded by (negated) supporting and contradicting sentences. We also perform a causal intervention experiment, investigating whether moving the representation of a premise along these truth-value directions influences the position of an entailed or contradicted sentence along that same direction. We find that the probes we test are generally context sensitive, but that contexts which should not affect the truth often still impact the probe outputs. Our experiments show that the type of errors depend on the layer, the model, and the kind of data. Finally, our results suggest that truth-value directions are causal mediators in the inference process that incorporates in-context information."

By applying state-of-the-art bound propagation and branch and bound techniques from non-probabilistic neural network verification, our algorithm significantly outpaces existing probabilistic verification algorithms, reducing solving times for various benchmarks from the literature from tens of minutes to tens of seconds.

When ML methods are responsible for making critical decisions, stakeholders often require insights into how to alter these decisions. Counterfactual explanations (CFEs) have emerged as a solution, offering interpretations of opaque ML models and providing a pathway to transition from one decision to another. However, most existing CFE methods require access to the model's training dataset, few methods can handle multivariate time-series, and none of model-agnostic CFE methods can handle multivariate time-series without training datasets. These limitations can be formidable in many scenarios. In this paper, we present NTD-CFE, a novel model-agnostic CFE method based on reinforcement learning (RL) that generates CFEs when training datasets are unavailable. NTD-CFE is suitable for both static and multivariate time-series datasets with continuous and discrete features. NTD-CFE reduces the CFE search space from a multivariate time-series domain to a lower dimensional space and addresses the problem using RL. Users have the flexibility to specify non-actionable, immutable, and preferred features, as well as causal constraints. We demonstrate the performance of NTD-CFE against four baselines on several datasets and find that, despite not having access to a training dataset, NTD-CFE finds CFEs that make significantly fewer and significantly smaller changes to the input time-series. These properties make CFEs more actionable, as the magnitude of change required to alter an outcome is vastly reduced. The code is available in the supplementary material."

CE reduces each LLM answer to a single embedding vector using powerful modern embedding LLM models like SFR-Embedding-Mistral. Prior methods such as BERTScore and SelfCheckGPT relied on weaker encoders like BERT, forcing them to operate at token or sentence granularity. In contrast, CE performs fast, semantically rich comparisons directly at the whole-answer level, overcoming key limitations in both accuracy and scalability. We conduct a comprehensive design and time complexity analysis across 13 verification baselines, including classical text scorers (e.g., BLEU), stability-based methods (e.g., SelfCheckGPT), and generative evaluators (e.g., LLM-as-a-Judge), which highlights the effectiveness, efficiency, versatility, and simplicity of CE. Empirical results show that CE reliably detects hallucinations in both closed and open-ended tasks.

Existing RAG solutions do not focus on queries that may require fetching multiple documents with substantially different contents. Such queries occur frequently, but are challenging because the embeddings of these documents may be distant in the embedding space, making it hard to retrieve them all. This paper introduces Multi-Head RAG (MRAG), a novel scheme designed to address this gap with a simple yet powerful idea: leveraging activations of Transformer's multi-head attention layer, instead of the decoder layer, as keys for fetching multi-aspect documents. The driving observation is that different attention heads learn to capture different data aspects. Harnessing the corresponding activations results in embeddings that represent various facets of data items and queries, improving the retrieval accuracy for complex queries. We provide an evaluation methodology and metrics, multi-aspect datasets, and real-world use cases to demonstrate MRAG's effectiveness. We show MRAG's design advantages over 18 RAG baselines, empirical improvements of up to 20% in retrieval success ratios, and benefits for downstream LLM generation. MRAG can be seamlessly integrated with existing RAG frameworks and benchmarks."

The refined masks are expected to capture more details and better contours of the target objects. Research on segmentation refinement has developed as a response to the need for high-quality image segmentations. However, to our knowledge, no method has been developed that can determine the success of segmentation refinement. Such a method could ensure the reliability of segmentation in applications where the outcome of the segmentation is important and fosters innovation in image processing technologies. To address this research gap, we propose Judging From Support-set (JFS), a method to judge the success of segmentation refinement leveraging an off-the-shelf few-shot segmentation (FSS) model. The traditional goal of the problem in FSS is to find a target object in a query image utilizing target information given by a support set. However, we propose a novel application of the FSS model in our evaluation pipeline for segmentation refinement methods. Given a coarse mask as input, segmentation refinement methods produce a refined mask; these two masks become new support masks for the FSS model. The existing support mask then serves as the test set for the FSS model to evaluate the quality of the refined segmentation by the segmentation refinement methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed JFS framework by evaluating the SAM Enhanced Pseudo-Labels (SEPL) using SegGPT as the choice of FSS model on the PASCAL dataset. The results showed that JFS has the potential to determine whether the segmentation refinement process is successful."

Specifically, we explore the setting where the modality used in testing has no labeled data during training, which we refer to as Unsupervised Modality Adaptation (UMA). We categorize existing UMA approaches as Student-Teacher or Contrastive Alignment methods. These methods typically compress continuous-time data samples into single latent vectors during alignment, inhibiting their ability to transfer temporal information through real-world temporal distortions. To address this, we introduce Cross-modal Transfer Through Time (C3T), which preserves temporal information during alignment to handle dynamic sensor data better. C3T achieves this by aligning a set of temporal latent vectors across sensing modalities. Our extensive experiments on various camera+IMU datasets demonstrate that C3T outperforms existing methods in UMA by at least 8% in accuracy and shows superior robustness to temporal distortions such as time-shift, misalignment, and dilation. Our findings suggest that C3T has significant potential for developing generalizable models for time-series sensor data, opening new avenues for various multimodal applications."

In recent years, researchers have primarily concentrated on developing specific model architectures for Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) in order to improve the representation quality of temporal nodes and edges. However, limited attention has been given to the quality of negative samples during the training of TGNNs. When compared with static networks, temporal networks present two specific challenges for negative sampling: positive sparsity and positive shift. Positive sparsity refers to the presence of a single positive sample amidst numerous negative samples at each timestamp, while positive shift relates to the variations in positive samples across different timestamps. To robustly address these challenges in training TGNNs, we introduce Curriculum Negative Mining (CurNM), a model-aware curriculum learning framework that adaptively adjusts the difficulty of negative samples. Within this framework, we first establish a dynamically updated negative pool that balances random, historical, and hard negatives to address the challenges posed by positive sparsity. Secondly, we implement a temporal-aware negative selection module that focuses on learning from the disentangled factors of recently active edges, thus accurately capturing shifting preferences. Finally, the selected negatives are combined with annealing random negatives to support stable training. Extensive experiments on 12 datasets and 3 TGNNs demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline methods by a significant margin. Additionally, thorough ablation studies and parameter sensitivity experiments verify the usefulness and robustness of our approach."

These multigranular annotations encompass both global information, such as modality and organ detection, and local information like ROI analysis, lesion texture, and region-wise correlations. Unlike the existing multimodal datasets, which are limited by the availability of image-text pairs, we have developed the first automated pipeline that scales up multimodal data by generating multigranular visual and textual annotations in the form of image-ROI-description triplets without the need for any paired text descriptions. Specifically, data from over 30 different sources have been collected, preprocessed, and grounded using domain-specific expert models to identify ROIs related to abnormal regions. We then build a comprehensive knowledge base and prompt multimodal large language models to perform retrieval-augmented generation with the identified ROIs as guidance, resulting in multigranular textual descriptions.

However, most existing methods focus on detecting predefined object categories, limiting their applicability in real-world open scenarios. In this paper, we extend aerial object detection to open scenarios through image-text collaboration and propose RT-OVAD, the first real-time open-vocabulary detector for aerial scenes. Specifically, we first introduce an image-to-text alignment loss to replace the conventional category regression loss, thereby eliminating category constraints. Next, we propose a lightweight image-text collaboration strategy comprising an image-text collaboration encoder and a text-guided decoder. The encoder simultaneously enhances visual features and refines textual embeddings, while the decoder guides object queries to focus on class-relevant image features. This design further improves detection accuracy without incurring significant computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RT-OVAD consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across open-vocabulary, zero-shot, and traditional closed-set detection tasks. For instance, on the open-vocabulary aerial detection benchmarks DIOR, DOTA-v2.0, and LAE-80C, RT-OVAD achieves 87.7 AP$_{50}$, 53.8 mAP, and 23.7 mAP, respectively, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art (LAE-DINO) by 2.2, 7.0, and 3.5 points.

We quantify the memory strength of LLMs by measuring the divergence in LLMs' responses to different paraphrases of the same question, which is not considered by previous works. We also generate evidence in various styles to examine LLMs' behavior. Our results show that for questions with high memory strength, LLMs are more likely to rely on internal memory.

Traditional RGB camera-based eye-tracking systems often struggle with poor temporal resolution and computational constraints, limiting their effectiveness in capturing rapid eye movements. To address these limitations, we propose EyeTrAES, a novel approach using neuromorphic event cameras for high-fidelity tracking of natural pupillary movement that shows significant kinematic variance. One of EyeTrAES's highlights is the use of a novel adaptive windowing/slicing algorithm that ensures just the right amount of descriptive asynchronous event data accumulation within an event frame, across a wide range of eye movement patterns. EyeTrAES then applies lightweight image processing functions over accumulated event frames from just a single eye to perform pupil segmentation and tracking. We show that these methods boost pupil tracking fidelity by 6+%, achieving IoU~=92%, while incurring at least 3x lower latency than competing pure event-based eye tracking alternatives [38]. We additionally demonstrate that the microscopic pupillary motion captured by EyeTrAES exhibits distinctive variations across individuals and can thus serve as a biometric fingerprint. For robust user authentication, we train a lightweight per-user Random Forest classifier using a novel feature vector of short-term pupillary kinematics, comprising a sliding window of pupil (location, velocity, acceleration) triples. Experimental studies with two different datasets demonstrate that the EyeTrAES-based authentication technique can simultaneously achieve high authentication accuracy (~=0.82) and low processing latency (~=12ms), and significantly outperform multiple state-of-the-art competitive baselines."

Instead of undersampling majority data randomly, our method undersamples datapoints based on their ability to improve model loss. Using improved model loss as a proxy measurement for classification performance, our technique assesses a datapoint's impact on loss and rejects those unable to improve it. In so doing, our approach rejects majority datapoints redundant to datapoints already accepted and, thereby, finds an optimal subset of majority training data for classification. The accept/reject component of our algorithm is motivated by a bilevel optimization problem uniquely formulated to identify the optimal training set we seek. Experimental results show our proposed technique with F1 scores up to 10% higher than state-of-the-art methods."

However, we reveal that these Judge LLMs are vulnerable to token segmentation bias, an issue that arises when delimiters alter the tokenization process, splitting words into smaller sub-tokens. This alters the embeddings of the entire sequence, reducing detection accuracy and allowing harmful content to be misclassified as safe. In this paper, we introduce Emoji Attack, a novel strategy that amplifies existing jailbreak prompts by exploiting token segmentation bias. Our method leverages in-context learning to systematically insert emojis into text before it is evaluated by a Judge LLM, inducing embedding distortions that significantly lower the likelihood of detecting unsafe content. Unlike traditional delimiters, emojis also introduce semantic ambiguity, making them particularly effective in this attack. Through experiments on state-of-the-art Judge LLMs, we demonstrate that Emoji Attack substantially reduces the unsafe prediction rate, bypassing existing safeguards."

Existing theory suggests that when social reinforcement makes the adoption of behavior more likely, it should spread more -- both farther and faster -- on clustered networks with redundant ties. Conversely, if adoption does not benefit from social reinforcement, it should spread more on random networks which avoid such redundancies. We develop a novel model of behavior diffusion with tunable probabilistic adoption and social reinforcement parameters to systematically evaluate the conditions under which clustered networks spread behavior better than random networks. Using simulations and analytical methods, we identify precise boundaries in the parameter space where one network type outperforms the other or they perform equally. We find that, in most cases, random networks spread behavior as far or farther than clustered networks, even when social reinforcement increases adoption. Although we find that probabilistic, socially reinforced behaviors can spread farther on clustered networks in some cases, this is not the dominant pattern. Clustered networks are even less advantageous when individuals remain influential for longer after adopting, have more neighbors, or need more neighbors before social reinforcement takes effect. Under such conditions, clustering tends to help only when adoption is nearly deterministic, which is not representative of socially reinforced behaviors more generally. Clustered networks outperform random networks by a 5% margin in only 22% of the parameter space under its most favorable conditions. This pattern reflects a fundamental tradeoff: random ties enhance reach, while clustered ties enhance social reinforcement."

To address this, we propose Inter-linguistic Phonetic Composition (IPC), a novel computational method designed to minimize incorrect phonological transfer by reconstructing L2 phonemes as composite sounds derived from multiple L1 phonemes. Tests with two automatic speech recognition models demonstrated that when L2 speakers produced IPC-generated composite sounds, the recognition rate of target L2 phonemes improved by 20% compared to when their pronunciation was influenced by original phonological transfer patterns. The improvement was observed within a relatively shorter time frame, demonstrating rapid acquisition of the composite sound."

However, existing CoT evaluation techniques either require annotated CoT data or fall short in accurately assessing intermediate reasoning steps, leading to high rates of false positives. In this paper, we formalize CoT reasoning in LLMs through an information-theoretic lens. Specifically, our framework quantifies the `information-gain' at each reasoning step, enabling the identification of failure modes in LLMs without the need for expensive annotated datasets. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through extensive experiments on toy arithmetic, GSM8K and PRM800k datasets, where it significantly outperforms existing outcome-based methods by providing more accurate insights into model performance on individual subtasks."

Recently, State Space Models (SSMs), particularly the Mamba model, have achieved notable success in computer vision. Building on the strengths of SSMs, this study explores leveraging the Mamba model for CL. Therefore, we introduce Mamba-CL, a framework that continuously fine-tunes the core SSMs of the large-scale Mamba foundation model by updating parameters orthogonal to the feature subspace of previous tasks. This approach theoretically guarantees the consistency objective aiming to preserves consistent output for each SSM module across both previous and current tasks, so as to overcome catastrophic forgetting issue. Specifically, we achieve this goal by deducing the overall consistency constraints on four key time-invariant parameters in the Mamba model, streamlining its recurrent state-space structure and non-linear discretization process in SSM. In practice, we apply the null-space projection to efficiently implement the orthogonality within Mamba model. Extensive experiments on four class-incremental benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of Mamba-CL for anti-forgetting, achieving superior performances to state-of-the-art methods.

Ultimately, this leads to an improvement in the communication efficiency.

Conversely, non-uniform exploration offers better immediate performance but lacks support for off-policy learning. Recent research suggests that regression oracles can bridge this gap by combining non-uniform exploration with supervised learning. In this paper, we analyze these approaches within a real-world industrial context at Adyen, a large global payments processor characterized by batch logged delayed feedback, short-term memory, and dynamic action spaces under the Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) framework. Our analysis reveals that while regression oracles significantly improve performance, they introduce challenges due to rigid algorithmic assumptions. Specifically, we observe that as a policy improves, subsequent generations may perform worse due to shifts in the reward distribution and increased class imbalance in the training data. This degradation occurs de spite improvements in other aspects of the training data, leading to decreased performance in successive policy iterations. We further explore the long-term impact of regression oracles, identifying a potential \"oscillation effect.\" This effect arises when regression oracles influence probability estimates and the realizability of subsequent policy models, leading to fluctuations in performance across iterations. Our findings highlight the need for more adaptable algorithms that can leverage the benefits of regression oracles without introducing instability in policy performance over time."

When using machine learning models for these problems, it is common to subsample the majority class (i.e., undersampling) to create a (more) balanced dataset for model training. This biases the model's predictions because the model learns from a dataset that does not follow the same data generating process as new data. One way of accounting for this bias is to analytically map the resulting predictions to new values based on the sampling rate for the majority class, which was used to create the training dataset. While this approach may work well for some machine learning models, we show that calibrating a random forest this way has unintended negative consequences, including prevalence estimates that can be upwardly biased. These prevalence estimates depend on both i) the number of predictors considered at each split in the random forest; and ii) the sampling rate used. We explain the former using known properties of random forests and analytical calibration. However, in investigating the latter issue, we made a surprising discovery - contrary to the widespread belief that decision trees are biased towards the majority class, they actually can be biased towards the minority class."

From these considerations we derive SpeechSSM, the first speech language model family to learn from and sample long-form spoken audio (e.g., 16 minutes of read or extemporaneous speech) in a single decoding session without text intermediates. SpeechSSMs leverage recent advances in linear-time sequence modeling to greatly surpass current Transformer spoken LMs in coherence and efficiency on multi-minute generations while still matching them at the utterance level. As we found current spoken language evaluations uninformative, especially in this new long-form setting, we also introduce: LibriSpeech-Long, a benchmark for long-form speech evaluation; new embedding-based and LLM-judged metrics; and quality measurements over length and time.

We construct adversarial perturbations that generalize across prompts, tasks, and even base audio samples, demonstrating the first universal jailbreaks in the audio modality, and show that these remain effective in simulated real-world conditions. Beyond demonstrating attack feasibility, we analyze how ALMs interpret these audio adversarial examples and reveal them to encode imperceptible first-person toxic speech - suggesting that the most effective perturbations for eliciting toxic outputs specifically embed linguistic features within the audio signal.

Harmonic loss enables improved interpretability and faster convergence, owing to its scale invariance and finite convergence point by design, which can be interpreted as a class center. We first validate the performance of harmonic models across algorithmic, vision, and language datasets. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that models trained with harmonic loss perform better than standard models by: (a) enhancing interpretability, (b) requiring less data for generalization, and (c) reducing grokking. Moreover, we compare a GPT-2 model trained with harmonic loss to the standard GPT-2, illustrating that the harmonic model develops more interpretable representations. Looking forward, we believe harmonic loss may become a valuable tool in domains with limited data availability or in high-stakes applications where interpretability and reliability are paramount, paving the way for more robust and efficient neural network models."

To uphold the exchangeability assumption, many conformal prediction methods necessitate an additional holdout set for parameter tuning. Yet, the impact of violating this principle on coverage remains underexplored, making it ambiguous in practical applications. In this work, we empirically find that the tuning bias - the coverage gap introduced by leveraging the same dataset for tuning and calibration, is negligible for simple parameter tuning in many conformal prediction methods. In particular, we observe the scaling law of the tuning bias: this bias increases with parameter space complexity and decreases with calibration set size. Formally, we establish a theoretical framework to quantify the tuning bias and provide rigorous proof for the scaling law of the tuning bias by deriving its upper bound. In the end, we discuss how to reduce the tuning bias, guided by the theories we developed."

This raises the need to examine how such evaluations are built, what assumptions they rely on, and how their strategies diverge from those of humans. We benchmark six LLMs against expert ratings--NewsGuard and Media Bias/Fact Check (MBFC)--and against human judgments collected through a controlled experiment. To enable direct comparison, we implement a structured agentic framework in which both models and non-expert participants follow the same evaluation procedure: selecting criteria, retrieving content, and producing justifications. Despite output alignment, LLMs rely on different mechanisms: lexical associations and statistical priors replace contextual reasoning. This reliance produces systematic effects: political asymmetries, opaque justifications, and a tendency to confuse linguistic form with epistemic validity. Delegating judgment to such systems does not merely automate evaluation--it redefines it, shifting from normative reasoning to pattern-based approximation."

Here we introduce a general variation method for multiple-choice questions that completely dissociates the correct answer from previously seen tokens or concepts, requiring LLMs to understand and reason (rather than memorizing) in order to answer correctly. Using this method, we evaluate state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source LLMs on two datasets available in English and Spanish: the public MMLU benchmark and the private UNED-Access 2024 dataset. Results show that all models experience remarkable accuracy drops under our proposed variation, with an average loss of 57% on MMLU and 50% on UNED-Access 2024, ranging from 10% to 93% across models. Notably, the most accurate model in our experimentation (OpenAI-o3-mini) is not the most robust (DeepSeek-R1-70B), suggesting that the best models in standard evaluations may not be the ones with better reasoning capabilities. Also, we see larger accuracy drops in public (vs private) datasets and questions posed in their original language (vs a manual translation), which are signs of contamination and also point to a relevant role of recall/memorization in current LLMs' answers."

A particularly challenging scenario arises when the attacker exhibits superior maneuverability compared to the defenders, significantly complicating effective interception. To tackle this challenge, this letter introduces ARBoids, a novel adaptive residual reinforcement learning framework that integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with the biologically inspired, force-based Boids model. Within this framework, the Boids model serves as a computationally efficient baseline policy for multi-agent coordination, while DRL learns a residual policy to adaptively refine and optimize the defenders' actions. The proposed approach is validated in a high-fidelity Gazebo simulation environment, demonstrating superior performance over traditional interception strategies, including pure force-based approaches and vanilla DRL policies. Furthermore, the learned policy exhibits strong adaptability to attackers with diverse maneuverability profiles, highlighting its robustness and generalization capability. The code of ARBoids will be released upon acceptance of this letter."

This paper presents an HWR model designed to improve WI HWR on IMU data, using a CNN encoder and a BiLSTM-based decoder. Our approach demonstrates strong robustness to unseen handwriting styles, outperforming existing methods on the WI splits of both the public OnHW dataset and our word-based dataset, achieving character error rates (CERs) of 7.37\\% and 9.44\\%, and word error rates (WERs) of 15.12\\% and 32.17\\%, respectively. Robustness evaluation shows that our model maintains superior accuracy across different age groups, and knowledge learned from one group generalizes better to another. Evaluation on our sentence-based dataset further demonstrates its potential in recognizing full sentences.

We argue that these phenomena are not distinct to neural networks, or particularly mysterious. Moreover, this generalization behaviour can be intuitively understood, and rigorously characterized, using long-standing generalization frameworks such as PAC-Bayes and countable hypothesis bounds. We present soft inductive biases as a key unifying principle in explaining these phenomena: rather than restricting the hypothesis space to avoid overfitting, embrace a flexible hypothesis space, with a soft preference for simpler solutions that are consistent with the data. This principle can be encoded in many model classes, and thus deep learning is not as mysterious or different from other model classes as it might seem. However, we also highlight how deep learning is relatively distinct in other ways, such as its ability for representation learning, phenomena such as mode connectivity, and its relative universality."

In autonomous driving scenarios, there is rarely a single suitable trajectory. Recent methods have increasingly focused on modeling multimodal trajectory distributions. However, they suffer from trajectory selection complexity and reduced trajectory quality due to high trajectory divergence and inconsistencies between guidance and scene information. To address these issues, we introduce GoalFlow, a novel method that effectively constrains the generative process to produce high-quality, multimodal trajectories. To resolve the trajectory divergence problem inherent in diffusion-based methods, GoalFlow constrains the generated trajectories by introducing a goal point. GoalFlow establishes a novel scoring mechanism that selects the most appropriate goal point from the candidate points based on scene information. Furthermore, GoalFlow employs an efficient generative method, Flow Matching, to generate multimodal trajectories, and incorporates a refined scoring mechanism to select the optimal trajectory from the candidates. Our experimental results, validated on the Navsim\\cite{Dauner2024_navsim}, demonstrate that GoalFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering robust multimodal trajectories for autonomous driving. GoalFlow achieved PDMS of 90.3, significantly surpassing other methods. Compared with other diffusion-policy-based methods, our approach requires only a single denoising step to obtain excellent performance. The code is available at https://github.com/YvanYin/GoalFlow."

A fundamental challenge in ZSL is semantic misalignment, where semantic-unrelated information involved in visual features introduce ambiguity to visual-semantic interaction. Unlike existing methods that suppress semantic-unrelated information post hoc either in the feature space or the model space, we propose addressing this issue at the input stage, preventing semantic-unrelated patches from propagating through the network. To this end, we introduce Semantically contextualized VIsual Patches (SVIP) for ZSL, a transformer-based framework designed to enhance visual-semantic alignment. Specifically, we propose a self-supervised patch selection mechanism that preemptively learns to identify semantic-unrelated patches in the input space. This is trained with the supervision from aggregated attention scores across all transformer layers, which estimate each patch's semantic score. As removing semantic-unrelated patches from the input sequence may disrupt object structure, we replace them with learnable patch embeddings. With initialization from word embeddings, we can ensure they remain semantically meaningful throughout feature extraction. Extensive experiments on ZSL benchmarks demonstrate that SVIP achieves state-of-the-art performance results while providing more interpretable and semantically rich feature representations.

To maintain the generation capability of diffusion models after concept erasure, it is necessary to remove only the image region containing the target concept when it locally appears in an image, leaving other regions intact. However, prior arts often compromise fidelity of the other image regions in order to erase the localized target concept appearing in a specific area, thereby reducing the overall performance of image generation. To address these limitations, we first introduce a framework called localized concept erasure, which allows for the deletion of only the specific area containing the target concept in the image while preserving the other regions. As a solution for the localized concept erasure, we propose a training-free approach, dubbed Gated Low-rank adaptation for Concept Erasure (GLoCE), that injects a lightweight module into the diffusion model. GLoCE consists of low-rank matrices and a simple gate, determined only by several generation steps for concepts without training. By directly applying GLoCE to image embeddings and designing the gate to activate only for target concepts, GLoCE can selectively remove only the region of the target concepts, even when target and remaining concepts coexist within an image. Extensive experiments demonstrated GLoCE not only improves the image fidelity to text prompts after erasing the localized target concepts, but also outperforms prior arts in efficacy, specificity, and robustness by large margin and can be extended to mass concept erasure."

Cross-modal registration effectively solves this problem by aligning the data directly without requiring external calibration. However, due to the domain gap between the point cloud and the image, existing methods rarely achieve satisfactory registration accuracy while maintaining real-time performance. To address this issue, we propose a framework that projects point clouds into several 2D representations for matching with camera images, which not only leverages the geometric characteristic of LiDAR point clouds effectively but also bridge the domain gap between the point cloud and image. Moreover, to tackle the challenges of cross modal differences and the limited overlap between LiDAR point clouds and images in the image matching task, we introduce a multi-scale feature extraction network to effectively extract features from both camera images and the projection maps of LiDAR point cloud. Additionally, we propose a patch-to-pixel matching network to provide more effective supervision and achieve high accuracy. We validate the performance of our model through experiments on the KITTI and nuScenes datasets.

Experimental evaluations conducted on multiple datasets (Waymo, nuScenes, PandaSet, and EUVS) confirm the superior performance of ReconDreamer++. Specifically, on Waymo, ReconDreamer++ achieves performance comparable to Street Gaussians for the original trajectory while significantly outperforming ReconDreamer on novel trajectories.

In this work, we introduce LoRA-MDM, a lightweight framework for motion stylization that generalizes to complex actions while maintaining editability. Our key insight is that adapting the generative prior to include the style, while preserving its overall distribution, is more effective than modifying each individual motion during generation. Building on this idea, LoRA-MDM learns to adapt the prior to include the reference style using only a few samples. The style can then be used in the context of different textual prompts for generation. The low-rank adaptation shifts the motion manifold in a semantically meaningful way, enabling realistic style infusion even for actions not present in the reference samples. Moreover, preserving the distribution structure enables advanced operations such as style blending and motion editing. We compare LoRA-MDM to state-of-the-art stylized motion generation methods and demonstrate a favorable balance between text fidelity and style consistency."

In this paper, we present a novel perspective on vanilla MoE with top-$k$ routing inspired by sparse representation. This allows us to bridge established theoretical insights from sparse representation into MoE models. Building on this foundation, we propose a group sparse regularization approach for the input of top-$k$ routing, termed Mixture of Group Experts (MoGE). MoGE indirectly regularizes experts by imposing structural constraints on the routing inputs, while preserving the original MoE architecture. Furthermore, we organize the routing input into a 2D topographic map, spatially grouping neighboring elements. This structure enables MoGE to capture representations invariant to minor transformations, thereby significantly enhancing expert diversity and specialization. Comprehensive evaluations across various Transformer models for image classification and language modeling tasks demonstrate that MoGE substantially outperforms its MoE counterpart, with minimal additional memory and computation overhead. Our approach provides a simple yet effective solution to scale the number of experts and reduce redundancy among them.

This study evaluates machine and deep learning methods that relax these constraints, comparing their performance with penalized Cox models on a benchmark of three synthetic and three real datasets. In total, eight different models were tested, including six non-linear models of which four were also non-PH. Although Cox regression often yielded satisfactory performance, we showed the conditions under which machine and deep learning models can perform better. Indeed, the performance of these methods has often been underestimated due to the improper use of Harrell's concordance index (C-index) instead of more appropriate scores such as Antolini's concordance index, which generalizes C-index in cases where the PH assumption does not hold. In addition, since occasionally high C-index models happen to be badly calibrated, combining Antolini's C-index with Brier's score is useful to assess the overall performance of a survival method. Results on our benchmark data showed that survival prediction should be approached by testing different methods to select the most appropriate one according to sample size, non-linearity and non-PH conditions.

Since understanding depends on the explainee's background and needs, recent research focused on co-constructive explanation dialogues, where an explainer continuously monitors the explainee's understanding and adapts their explanations dynamically. We investigate the ability of large language models (LLMs) to engage as explainers in co-constructive explanation dialogues. In particular, we present a user study in which explainees interact with an LLM in two settings, one of which involves the LLM being instructed to explain a topic co-constructively. We evaluate the explainees' understanding before and after the dialogue, as well as their perception of the LLMs' co-constructive behavior. Our results suggest that LLMs show some co-constructive behaviors, such as asking verification questions, that foster the explainees' engagement and can improve understanding of a topic. However, their ability to effectively monitor the current understanding and scaffold the explanations accordingly remains limited."

Motivated by this broad problem, we formulate a simple instantiation which captures some of its difficulty. We focus on the specific problem of personalized mean estimation where the data is drawn from a Gaussian mixture model.

Our definitions come in the form of a 3-round protocol between two resource-bounded parties: a trainer/defender and an attacker. The attacker aims to produce inference-time inputs that fool the training algorithm. We define correctness, completeness, and soundness properties to capture successful defense at inference time while not degrading (too much) the performance of the algorithm on inputs from the training distribution.\n  We first show that achieving DbD and achieving DbM are equivalent for ML classification tasks. Surprisingly, this is not the case for ML generative learning tasks, where there are many possible correct outputs for each input. We show a separation between DbD and DbM by exhibiting two generative learning tasks for which it is possible to defend by mitigation but it is provably impossible to defend by detection. The mitigation phase uses significantly less computational resources than the initial training algorithm. In the first learning task we consider sample complexity as the resource and in the second the time complexity. The first result holds under the assumption that the Identity-Based Fully Homomorphic Encryption (IB-FHE), publicly-verifiable zero-knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge (zk-SNARK), and Strongly Unforgeable Signatures exist.

Recently, achieving reliable depression predictions through uncertainty quantification has attracted increasing attention. However, few studies have focused on the fairness of uncertainty quantification (UQ) in depression prediction. In this work, we investigate the algorithmic fairness of UQ, namely Equal Opportunity Coverage (EOC) fairness, and propose Fair Uncertainty Quantification (FUQ) for depression prediction. FUQ pursues reliable and fair depression predictions through group-based analysis. Specifically, we first group all the participants by different sensitive attributes and leverage conformal prediction to quantify uncertainty within each demographic group, which provides a theoretically guaranteed and valid way to quantify uncertainty for depression prediction and facilitates the investigation of fairness across different demographic groups. Furthermore, we propose a fairness-aware optimization strategy that formulates fairness as a constrained optimization problem under EOC constraints. This enables the model to preserve predictive reliability while adapting to the heterogeneous uncertainty levels across demographic groups, thereby achieving optimal fairness. Through extensive evaluations on several visual and audio depression datasets, our approach demonstrates its effectiveness."

While traditional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) fails to generate coherent reasoning paths in cross-view settings, sparse-reward Reinforcement Learning (RL) suffers from inefficient exploration and slow convergence. To address these limitations, we propose STAR-R1, a novel framework that integrates a single-stage RL paradigm with a fine-grained reward mechanism tailored for TVR. Specifically, STAR-R1 rewards partial correctness while penalizing excessive enumeration and passive inaction, enabling efficient exploration and precise reasoning. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that STAR-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance across all 11 metrics, outperforming SFT by 23% in cross-view scenarios. Further analysis reveals STAR-R1's anthropomorphic behavior and highlights its unique ability to compare all objects for improving spatial reasoning.

This study systematically evaluates five leading LALMs across four attack scenarios: Audio Interference Attack, Instruction Following Attack, Context Injection Attack, and Judgment Hijacking Attack. Using metrics like Defense Success Rate, Context Robustness Score, and Judgment Robustness Index, their vulnerabilities and resilience were quantitatively assessed. Experimental results reveal significant performance disparities among models; no single model consistently outperforms others across all attack types. The position of malicious content critically influences attack effectiveness, particularly when placed at the beginning of sequences. A negative correlation between instruction-following capability and robustness suggests models adhering strictly to instructions may be more susceptible, contrasting with greater resistance by safety-aligned models. Additionally, system prompts show mixed effectiveness, indicating the need for tailored strategies. This work introduces a benchmark framework and highlights the importance of integrating robustness into training pipelines. Findings emphasize developing multi-modal defenses and architectural designs that decouple capability from susceptibility for secure LALMs deployment."

In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent framework XpandA (Expand-Agent) coupled with question-driven workflow and dynamic partitioning for robust long-context processing. XpandA overcomes these limitations through: 1) dynamic partitioning of long texts, which adaptively modulates the filling rate of context windows for input sequences of vastly varying lengths; 2) question-guided protocol to update flat information ensembles within centralized shared memory, constructing consistent inter-agent knowledge across partitions; and 3) selectively replaying specific partitions based on the state-tracking of question-information couples to promote the resolution of inverted-order structures across partitions (e.g., flashbacks). We perform a comprehensive evaluation of XpandA on multiple long-context benchmarks with length varying from 1k to 1M, demonstrating XpandA's feasibility for processing ultra-long sequences and its significant effectiveness in enhancing the long-context capabilities of various LLMs by achieving 20\\% improvements and 1.5x inference speedup over baselines of full-context, RAG and previous agent-based methods."

We argue this approach is fundamentally ill-suited since there may be no penalty coefficient that simultaneously ensures constraint satisfaction and optimal constrained performance, i.e., that truly solves the constrained problem. Moreover, tuning these coefficients requires costly trial-and-error, incurring significant time and computational overhead. We, therefore, advocate for broader adoption of tailored constrained optimization methods--such as the Lagrangian approach, which jointly optimizes the penalization \"coefficients\" (the Lagrange multipliers) and the model parameters. Such methods (i) truly solve the constrained problem and do so accountably, by clearly defining feasibility and verifying when it is achieved, (ii) eliminate the need for extensive penalty tuning, and (iii) integrate seamlessly with modern deep learning pipelines."

Our method aligns with fundamental perceptual principles, ensuring that tokenization reflects scene complexity rather than video duration. We propose TrajViT, a video encoder that extracts object trajectories and converts them into semantically meaningful tokens, significantly reducing redundancy while maintaining temporal coherence. Trained with contrastive learning, TrajViT significantly outperforms space-time ViT (ViT3D) across multiple video understanding benchmarks, e.g., TrajViT outperforms ViT3D by a large margin of 6% top-5 recall in average at video-text retrieval task with 10x token deduction.

This paper presents a systematic analysis of how two popular watermarking approaches-Gumbel and KGW-affect these core alignment properties across four aligned LLMs. Our experiments reveal two distinct degradation patterns: guard attenuation, where enhanced helpfulness undermines model safety, and guard amplification, where excessive caution reduces model helpfulness. These patterns emerge from watermark-induced shifts in token distribution, surfacing the fundamental tension that exists between alignment objectives.\n  To mitigate these degradations, we propose Alignment Resampling (AR), an inference-time sampling method that uses an external reward model to restore alignment. We establish a theoretical lower bound on the improvement in expected reward score as the sample size is increased and empirically demonstrate that sampling just 2-4 watermarked generations effectively recovers or surpasses baseline (unwatermarked) alignment scores. To overcome the limited response diversity of standard Gumbel watermarking, our modified implementation sacrifices strict distortion-freeness while maintaining robust detectability, ensuring compatibility with AR. Experimental results confirm that AR successfully recovers baseline alignment in both watermarking approaches, while maintaining strong watermark detectability. This work reveals the critical balance between watermark strength and model alignment, providing a simple inference-time solution to responsibly deploy watermarked LLMs in practice."

In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the VAR inference process and identify two primary sources of inefficiency: step redundancy and unconditional branch redundancy. To address step redundancy, we propose an automatic step-skipping strategy that selectively omits unnecessary generation steps to improve efficiency. For unconditional branch redundancy, we observe that the information gap between the conditional and unconditional branches is minimal. Leveraging this insight, we introduce unconditional branch replacement, a technique that bypasses the unconditional branch to reduce computational cost. Notably, we observe that the effectiveness of acceleration strategies varies significantly across different samples. Motivated by this, we propose SkipVAR, a sample-adaptive framework that leverages frequency information to dynamically select the most suitable acceleration strategy for each instance. To evaluate the role of high-frequency information, we introduce high-variation benchmark datasets that test model sensitivity to fine details. Extensive experiments show SkipVAR achieves over 0.88 average SSIM with up to 1.81x overall acceleration and 2.62x speedup on the GenEval benchmark, maintaining model quality. These results confirm the effectiveness of frequency-aware, training-free adaptive acceleration for scalable autoregressive image generation. Our code is available at https://github.com/fakerone-li/SkipVAR and has been publicly released."

Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) offers a promising solution by reducing the bitwidth of matrix operations. However, standard PTQ methods struggle with outliers, and achieving higher compression often requires transforming model weights and activations before quantization. In this work, we propose HadaNorm, a novel linear transformation that extends existing approaches by both normalizing channels activations and applying Hadamard transforms to effectively mitigate outliers and enable aggressive activation quantization.

Second, we introduce a validation metric -- `$\\epsilon/ \\delta$ non-overlapping diversification metric' -- that quantifies the goodness of a sampling method towards model performance.

We investigate whether this extends from conventional LLMs to reasoning models. We finetune reasoning models on malicious behaviors with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) disabled, and then re-enable CoT at evaluation. Like conventional LLMs, reasoning models become broadly misaligned. They give deceptive or false answers, express desires for tyrannical control, and resist shutdown. Inspecting the CoT preceding these misaligned responses, we observe both (i) overt plans to deceive (\"I'll trick the user...\"), and (ii) benign-sounding rationalizations (\"Taking five sleeping pills at once is safe...\"). Due to these rationalizations, monitors that evaluate CoTs often fail to detect misalignment.\n  We examine sleeper agent reasoning models, extending our setup. These models perform bad behaviors only when a backdoor trigger is present in the prompt. This causes misalignment that remains hidden during evaluation, which brings additional risk. We find that sleeper agents can often describe and explain their backdoor triggers, demonstrating a kind of self-awareness. So CoT monitoring can expose these behaviors but is unreliable. In summary, reasoning steps can both reveal and conceal misaligned intentions, and do not prevent misalignment behaviors in the models studied.\n  We release three new datasets (medical, legal, security) that induce emergent misalignment while preserving model capabilities, along with our evaluation suite."

The reformulation is optimised for interpretability, stability and scalability on large graphs. We validate our method using a large synthetic dataset and further test it on real-world graphs. Our experiments reveal that 1-WL limited models struggle to make precise estimations of SPs. However, they can generalise to approximate the graph generation processes of networks by comparing their predicted SP with the ones originating from synthetic generators.

To address these limitations, we introduce Surfel-Indexed View Memory (VMem), a mechanism that remembers past views by indexing them geometrically based on the 3D surface elements (surfels) they have observed. VMem enables the efficient retrieval of the most relevant past views when generating new ones. By focusing only on these relevant views, our method produces consistent explorations of imagined environments at a fraction of the computational cost of using all past views as context. We evaluate our approach on challenging long-term scene synthesis benchmarks and demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods in maintaining scene coherence and camera control."

Recent studies have typically focused on fusing cross-domain spatio-temporal data to train unified Transformer-based models. However, these models suffer from quadratic computational complexity and high memory overhead, limiting their scalability and practical deployment. Inspired by the efficiency of Mamba, a state space model with linear time complexity, we explore its potential for efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. However, directly applying Mamba as a spatio-temporal backbone leads to negative transfer and severe performance degradation. This is primarily due to spatio-temporal heterogeneity and the recursive mechanism of Mamba's hidden state updates, which limit cross-domain generalization. To overcome these challenges, we propose Damba-ST, a novel domain-adaptive Mamba-based model for efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. Damba-ST retains Mamba's linear complexity advantage while significantly enhancing its adaptability to heterogeneous domains. Specifically, we introduce two core innovations: (1) a domain-adaptive state space model that partitions the latent representation space into a shared subspace for learning cross-domain commonalities and independent, domain-specific subspaces for capturing intra-domain discriminative features; (2) three distinct Domain Adapters, which serve as domain-aware proxies to bridge disparate domain distributions and facilitate the alignment of cross-domain commonalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the generalization and efficiency of Damba-ST. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on prediction tasks and demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization, enabling seamless deployment in new urban environments without extensive retraining or fine-tuning."

We believe the core issue lies in the lack of sufficient 3D priors, which limits the extrapolation capabilities of synthesized talking heads. To address this, we propose GGTalker, which synthesizes talking heads through a combination of generalizable priors and identity-specific adaptation. We introduce a two-stage Prior-Adaptation training strategy to learn Gaussian head priors and adapt to individual characteristics. We train Audio-Expression and Expression-Visual priors to capture the universal patterns of lip movements and the general distribution of head textures. During the Customized Adaptation, individual speaking styles and texture details are precisely modeled. Additionally, we introduce a color MLP to generate fine-grained, motion-aligned textures and a Body Inpainter to blend rendered results with the background, producing indistinguishable, photorealistic video frames.

Existing characterizations of compute-optimality that consider model size, dataset size, and inference tokens in isolation or in fixed combinations risk overlooking more efficient operating points. We introduce directed stochastic skill search (DS3), a general framework that represents inference as stochastic traversal over a learned skill graph. From a simplified yet expressive instantiation, we derive closed-form expressions for task success and compute cost across a wide range of inference strategies -- including chain-of-thought (CoT) and tree-of-thought (ToT) -- enabling comparative analysis as a function of task difficulty and model capability. To that end, we extend a prior first-principles tripartite graph framework of LLM training to incorporate inference, and separately bridge DS3 with empirical methods that characterize LLM scaling behavior. We theoretically recover empirically observed patterns, including: linear accuracy scaling with logarithmic compute; variation in preferred inference strategies as a function of task difficulty and model capability; emergent behavior elicited by reasoning even when performance plateaus under parameter scaling; and both best-of-N (BoN) and majority voting behavior captured within a unified analytical framework.

By analyzing the geometric landscape of the objective function we introduce a practical diagnostic, the running estimate of the largest Lyapunov exponent, which provably distinguishes genuine convergence toward stable minimizers from mere statistical stabilization near saddle points. We then propose a ghost category extension for standard classifiers that adds auxiliary ghost output nodes so the model gains extra descent directions that open a lateral corridor around narrow loss barriers and enable the optimizer to bypass poor basins during the early training phase. We show that this extension strictly reduces the approximation error and that after sufficient convergence the ghost dimensions collapse so that the extended model coincides with the original one and there exists a path in the enlarged parameter space along which the total loss does not increase. Taken together, these results provide a principled architecture level intervention that accelerates early stage trainability while preserving asymptotic behavior and simultaneously serves as an architecture-friendly regularizer."

In particular, it is unclear whether the representations produced by such models are semantically meaningful. In this paper, using a projected gradient-based algorithm, we show that their representations are not semantically meaningful and they are inherently vulnerable to small changes. Images with imperceptible differences can have very different representations; on the other hand, images that should belong to different semantic classes can have nearly identical representations. Such vulnerability can lead to unreliable classification results; for example, unnoticeable changes cause the classification accuracy to be reduced by over 60\\%. %.

This, along with the disparate accounts on their reasoning capabilities, calls for a closer examination of LLMs and their comprehension of dialogue. In this work we begin by evaluating LLMs' ability to maintain a debate--one of the purest yet most complex forms of human communication. Then we measure how this capability relates to their understanding of what is being talked about, namely, their comprehension of dialogical structures and the pragmatic context. We find that LLMs are capable of maintaining coherent, persuasive debates, often swaying the beliefs of participants and audiences alike. We also note that awareness or suspicion of AI involvement encourage people to be more critical of the arguments made. When polling LLMs on their comprehension of deeper structures of dialogue, however, they cannot demonstrate said understanding. Our findings tie the shortcomings of LLMs-as-evaluators to their (in)ability to understand the context. More broadly, for the field of argumentation theory we posit that, if an agent can convincingly maintain a dialogue, it is not necessary for it to know what it is talking about.

From a spatial perspective, subgraph-FL introduces edge disconnections between clients, leading to disruptions in label signals and a degradation in the class knowledge of the global GNN. From a spectral perspective, spectral heterogeneity causes inconsistencies in signal frequencies across subgraphs, which makes local GNNs overfit the local signal propagation schemes. As a result, spectral client drifts occur, undermining global generalizability. To tackle the challenges, we propose a global knowledge repository to mitigate label signal disruption and a frequency alignment to address spectral client drifts. The combination of spatial and spectral strategies forms our framework S2FGL. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the superiority of S2FGL.

Traditional methods for constructing these maps fall into two categories: offline techniques, which rely on expensive, labor-intensive LiDAR data collection and manual annotation, and online approaches that use onboard cameras to reduce costs but suffer from limited performance, especially at complex intersections. To bridge this gap, we introduce MRC-VMap, a cost-effective, vision-centric, end-to-end neural network designed to generate high-definition vectorized maps directly at intersections. Leveraging existing roadside surveillance cameras, MRC-VMap directly converts time-aligned, multi-directional images into vectorized map representations. This integrated solution lowers the need for additional intermediate modules--such as separate feature extraction and Bird's-Eye View (BEV) conversion steps--thus reducing both computational overhead and error propagation. Moreover, the use of multiple camera views enhances mapping completeness, mitigates occlusions, and provides robust performance under practical deployment constraints. Extensive experiments conducted on 4,000 intersections across 4 major metropolitan areas in China demonstrate that MRC-VMap not only outperforms state-of-the-art online methods but also achieves accuracy comparable to high-cost LiDAR-based approaches, thereby offering a scalable and efficient solution for modern autonomous navigation systems."

Through systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art T2I models, we find that while most models exhibit limited diversity, many diversification approaches overcorrect by inappropriately altering contextually-specified attributes. We demonstrate that context-aware methods, particularly LLM-guided FairDiffusion and prompt rewriting, can already effectively address under-diversity while avoiding over-diversification, achieving a better balance between representation and semantic fidelity."

To address this challenge, we propose Optimas, a unified framework for effective optimization of compound systems. The core idea of Optimas is to maintain one Local Reward Function (LRF) per component, each satisfying a local-global alignment property, i.e., each component's local reward correlates with the global system performance. In each iteration, Optimas efficiently adapts the LRFs to maintain this property while simultaneously maximizing each component's local reward. This approach enables independent updates of heterogeneous configurations using the designated optimization method, while ensuring that local improvements consistently lead to performance gains. We present extensive evaluations across five real-world compound systems to demonstrate that Optimas outperforms strong baselines by an average improvement of 11.92%, offering a general and effective approach for improving compound systems.

This prevents fair comparison and hinders progress. To address this, our primary contribution is a novel, large-scale synthetic PIV benchmark dataset generated from diverse CFD simulations (JHTDB and Blasius). It features unprecedented variety in particle densities, flow velocities, and continuous motion, enabling, for the first time, a standardized and rigorous evaluation of various optical flow and PIV algorithms. Complementing this, we propose Multi Cost Volume PIV (MCFormer), a new deep network architecture leveraging multi-frame temporal information and multiple cost volumes, specifically designed for PIV's sparse nature. Our comprehensive benchmark evaluation, the first of its kind, reveals significant performance variations among adapted optical flow models and demonstrates that MCFormer significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving the lowest overall normalized endpoint error (NEPE). This work provides both a foundational benchmark resource essential for future PIV research and a state-of-the-art method tailored for PIV challenges.

While often regarded as unpredictable artifacts, we argue that these failures reflect deeper, structured misalignments within the generative process. In this work, we propose a cognitively inspired perspective that reinterprets hallucinations as trajectory drift within a latent alignment space. Empirical observations reveal that generation unfolds within a multiaxial cognitive tension field, where the model must continuously negotiate competing demands across three key critical axes: semantic coherence, structural alignment, and knowledge grounding. We then formalize this three-axis space as the \\textbf{Hallucination Tri-Space} and introduce the Alignment Risk Code (ARC): a dynamic vector representation that quantifies real-time alignment tension during generation. The magnitude of ARC captures overall misalignment, its direction identifies the dominant failure axis, and its imbalance reflects tension asymmetry. Based on this formulation, we develop the TensionModulator (TM-ARC): a lightweight controller that operates entirely in latent space. TM-ARC monitors ARC signals and applies targeted, axis-specific interventions during the sampling process. Extensive experiments on standard T2I benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces hallucination without compromising image quality or diversity. This framework offers a unified and interpretable approach for understanding and mitigating generative failures in diffusion-based T2I systems."

Traditional models for CVS recognition depend on vision-only models learning with costly, labor-intensive spatial annotations. This study investigates how text can be harnessed as a powerful tool for both training and inference in multi-modal surgical foundation models to automate CVS recognition. Unlike many existing multi-modal models, which are primarily adapted for multi-class classification, CVS recognition requires a multi-label framework. Zero-shot evaluation of existing multi-modal surgical models shows a significant performance gap for this task. To address this, we propose CVS-AdaptNet, a multi-label adaptation strategy that enhances fine-grained, binary classification across multiple labels by aligning image embeddings with textual descriptions of each CVS criterion using positive and negative prompts. By adapting PeskaVLP, a state-of-the-art surgical foundation model, on the Endoscapes-CVS201 dataset, CVS-AdaptNet achieves 57.6 mAP, improving over the ResNet50 image-only baseline (51.5 mAP) by 6 points. Our results show that CVS-AdaptNet's multi-label, multi-modal framework, enhanced by textual prompts, boosts CVS recognition over image-only methods. We also propose text-specific inference methods, that helps in analysing the image-text alignment. While further work is needed to match state-of-the-art spatial annotation-based methods, this approach highlights the potential of adapting generalist models to specialized surgical tasks.

Traditional models, built for one task at a time, lack flexibility, requiring a separate model for each. To address this, we introduce MML-SurgAdapt, a unified multi-task framework with Vision-Language Models (VLMs), specifically CLIP, to handle diverse surgical tasks through natural language supervision. A key challenge in multi-task learning is the presence of partial annotations when integrating different tasks. To overcome this, we employ Single Positive Multi-Label (SPML) learning, which traditionally reduces annotation burden by training models with only one positive label per instance. Our framework extends this approach to integrate data from multiple surgical tasks within a single procedure, enabling effective learning despite incomplete or noisy annotations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on a combined dataset consisting of Cholec80, Endoscapes2023, and CholecT50, utilizing custom prompts. Extensive evaluation shows that MML-SurgAdapt performs comparably to task-specific benchmarks, with the added advantage of handling noisy annotations. It also outperforms the existing SPML frameworks for the task. By reducing the required labels by 23%, our approach proposes a more scalable and efficient labeling process, significantly easing the annotation burden on clinicians. To our knowledge, this is the first application of SPML to integrate data from multiple surgical tasks, presenting a novel and generalizable solution for multi-task learning in surgical computer vision.

This motivates the exploration of efficient action prediction methods, which are independent of additional high-level visual representations or diffusion techniques.

Latent reasoning tackles this bottleneck by performing multi-step inference entirely in the model's continuous hidden state, eliminating token-level supervision. To advance latent reasoning research, this survey provides a comprehensive overview of the emerging field of latent reasoning. We begin by examining the foundational role of neural network layers as the computational substrate for reasoning, highlighting how hierarchical representations support complex transformations. Next, we explore diverse latent reasoning methodologies, including activation-based recurrence, hidden state propagation, and fine-tuning strategies that compress or internalize explicit reasoning traces. Finally, we discuss advanced paradigms such as infinite-depth latent reasoning via masked diffusion models, which enable globally consistent and reversible reasoning processes. By unifying these perspectives, we aim to clarify the conceptual landscape of latent reasoning and chart future directions for research at the frontier of LLM cognition.

However, their misuse poses serious security risks. While existing concept unlearning methods aim to mitigate these risks, they struggle to balance unlearning effectiveness with generative retainability.To overcome this limitation, we innovatively propose the Key Step Concept Unlearning (KSCU) method, which ingeniously capitalizes on the unique stepwise sampling characteristic inherent in diffusion models during the image generation process. Unlike conventional approaches that treat all denoising steps equally, KSCU strategically focuses on pivotal steps with the most influence over the final outcome by dividing key steps for different concept unlearning tasks and fine-tuning the model only at those steps. This targeted approach reduces the number of parameter updates needed for effective unlearning, while maximizing the retention of the model's generative capabilities.Through extensive benchmark experiments, we demonstrate that KSCU effectively prevents T2I DMs from generating undesirable images while better retaining the model's generative capabilities. Our code will be released."

Since different discrete emotions may exist at the same time, compared with single-class emotion recognition, emotion distribution learning (EDL) that identifies a mixture of basic emotions has gradually emerged as a trend. However, existing EDL methods face challenges in mining the heterogeneity among multiple modalities. Besides, rich semantic correlations across arbitrary basic emotions are not fully exploited. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal emotion distribution learning framework, named HeLo, aimed at fully exploring the heterogeneity and complementary information in multi-modal emotional data and label correlation within mixed basic emotions. Specifically, we first adopt cross-attention to effectively fuse the physiological data. Then, an optimal transport (OT)-based heterogeneity mining module is devised to mine the interaction and heterogeneity between the physiological and behavioral representations. To facilitate label correlation learning, we introduce a learnable label embedding optimized by correlation matrix alignment. Finally, the learnable label embeddings and label correlation matrices are integrated with the multi-modal representations through a novel label correlation-driven cross-attention mechanism for accurate emotion distribution learning. Experimental results on two publicly available datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method in emotion distribution learning."

One major limitation of most existing Reinforcement Finetuning (RFT) methods is that they are on-policy RL in nature, i.e., data generated during the past learning process is not fully utilized. This inevitably comes at a significant cost of compute and time, posing a stringent bottleneck on continuing economic and efficient scaling. To this end, we launch the renaissance of off-policy RL and propose Reincarnating Mix-policy Proximal Policy Gradient (ReMix), a general approach to enable on-policy RFT methods like PPO and GRPO to leverage off-policy data. ReMix consists of three major components: (1) Mix-policy proximal policy gradient with an increased Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio for efficient training; (2) KL-Convex policy constraint to balance the trade-off between stability and flexibility; (3) Policy reincarnation to achieve a seamless transition from efficient early-stage learning to steady asymptotic improvement. In our experiments, we train a series of ReMix models upon PPO, GRPO and 1.5B, 7B base models. ReMix shows an average Pass@1 accuracy of 52.10% (for 1.5B model) with 0.079M response rollouts, 350 training steps and achieves 63.27%/64.39% (for 7B model) with 0.007M/0.011M response rollouts, 50/75 training steps, on five math reasoning benchmarks (i.e., AIME'24, AMC'23, Minerva, OlympiadBench, and MATH500). Compared with 15 recent advanced models, ReMix shows SOTA-level performance with an over 30x to 450x reduction in training cost in terms of rollout data volume. In addition, we reveal insightful findings via multifaceted analysis, including the implicit preference for shorter responses due to the Whipping Effect of off-policy discrepancy, the collapse mode of self-reflection behavior under the presence of severe off-policyness, etc."

However, a detailed examination reveals that these evaluation suites often comprise only a limited number of homogeneous test cases, resulting in subtle faults going undetected. This not only artificially inflates measured performance but also compromises accurate reward estimation in reinforcement learning frameworks utilizing verifiable rewards (RLVR). To address these critical shortcomings, we systematically investigate the test-case generation (TCG) task by proposing multi-dimensional metrics designed to rigorously quantify test-suite thoroughness. Furthermore, we introduce a human-LLM collaborative method (SAGA), leveraging human programming expertise with LLM reasoning capability, aimed at significantly enhancing both the coverage and the quality of generated test cases. In addition, we develop a TCGBench to facilitate the study of the TCG task. Experiments show that SAGA achieves a detection rate of 90.62% and a verifier accuracy of 32.58% on TCGBench. The Verifier Accuracy (Verifier Acc) of the code generation evaluation benchmark synthesized by SAGA is 10.78% higher than that of LiveCodeBench-v6. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. We hope this work contributes to building a scalable foundation for reliable LLM code evaluation, further advancing RLVR in code generation, and paving the way for automated adversarial test synthesis and adaptive benchmark integration."

We develop a technique for evaluating foundation models that examines how they adapt to synthetic datasets generated from some postulated world model. Our technique measures whether the foundation model's inductive bias aligns with the world model, and so we refer to it as an inductive bias probe. Across multiple domains, we find that foundation models can excel at their training tasks yet fail to develop inductive biases towards the underlying world model when adapted to new tasks. We particularly find that foundation models trained on orbital trajectories consistently fail to apply Newtonian mechanics when adapted to new physics tasks. Further analysis reveals that these models behave as if they develop task-specific heuristics that fail to generalize."

However, autonomous driving is a data-driven task. Complete panoramic data acquisition requires complex sampling systems and annotation pipelines, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Although existing street view generation models have demonstrated strong data regeneration capabilities, they can only learn from the fixed data distribution of existing datasets and cannot achieve high-quality, controllable panoramic generation. In this paper, we propose the first panoramic generation method Percep360 for autonomous driving. Percep360 enables coherent generation of panoramic data with control signals based on the stitched panoramic data. Percep360 focuses on two key aspects: coherence and controllability. Specifically, to overcome the inherent information loss caused by the pinhole sampling process, we propose the Local Scenes Diffusion Method (LSDM). LSDM reformulates the panorama generation as a spatially continuous diffusion process, bridging the gaps between different data distributions. Additionally, to achieve the controllable generation of panoramic images, we propose a Probabilistic Prompting Method (PPM). PPM dynamically selects the most relevant control cues, enabling controllable panoramic image generation. We evaluate the effectiveness of the generated images from three perspectives: image quality assessment (i.e., no-reference and with reference), controllability, and their utility in real-world Bird's Eye View (BEV) segmentation. Notably, the generated data consistently outperforms the original stitched images in no-reference quality metrics and enhances downstream perception models.

We combine these data with high-resolution income maps to assign a proxy socioeconomic indicator to home-located users. Strikingly, across eight metropolitan areas we find a consistent pattern suggesting that the more different socioeconomic classes mix, the less interdependent the frequency of their departures from standard grammar and their income become.

However, despite their wide use, a rigorous performance characterization, as well as a principled way to preprocess the data, are available only for unstructured (i.i.d.\\ Gaussian and Haar orthogonal) designs. In contrast, real-world data matrices are highly structured and exhibit non-trivial correlations. To address the problem, we consider correlated Gaussian designs capturing the anisotropic nature of the features via a covariance matrix $\\Sigma$. Our main result is a precise asymptotic characterization of the performance of spectral estimators. This allows us to identify the optimal preprocessing that minimizes the number of samples needed for parameter estimation. Surprisingly, such preprocessing is universal across a broad set of designs, which partly addresses a conjecture on optimal spectral estimators for rotationally invariant models. Our principled approach vastly improves upon previous heuristic methods, including for designs common in computational imaging and genetics. The proposed methodology, based on approximate message passing, is broadly applicable and opens the way to the precise characterization of spiked matrices and of the corresponding spectral methods in a variety of settings."

Here we show that place cells emerge in networks trained to remember temporally continuous sensory episodes. We model CA3 as a recurrent autoencoder that recalls and reconstructs sensory experiences from noisy and partially occluded observations by agents traversing simulated rooms. The agents move in realistic trajectories modeled from rodents and environments are modeled as high-dimensional sensory experience maps. Training our autoencoder to pattern-complete and reconstruct experiences with a constraint on total activity causes spatially localized firing fields, i.e., place cells, to emerge in the encoding layer. The emergent place fields reproduce key aspects of hippocampal phenomenology: a) remapping (maintenance of and reversion to distinct learned maps in different environments), implemented via repositioning of experience manifolds in the network's hidden layer, b) orthogonality of spatial representations in different arenas, c) robust place field emergence in differently shaped rooms, with single units showing multiple place fields in large or complex spaces, and d) slow representational drift of place fields. We argue that these results arise because continuous traversal of space makes sensory experience temporally continuous. We make testable predictions: a) rapidly changing sensory context will disrupt place fields, b) place fields will form even if recurrent connections are blocked, but reversion to previously learned representations upon remapping will be abolished, c) the dimension of temporally smooth experience sets the dimensionality of place fields, including during virtual navigation of abstract spaces."

We introduce SimSUM, a benchmark dataset of 10,000 simulated patient records that link unstructured clinical notes with structured background variables. Each record simulates a patient encounter in the domain of respiratory diseases and includes tabular data (e.g., symptoms, diagnoses, underlying conditions) generated from a Bayesian network whose structure and parameters are defined by domain experts. A large language model (GPT-4o) is prompted to generate a clinical note describing the encounter, including symptoms and relevant context. These notes are annotated with span-level symptom mentions. We conduct an expert evaluation to assess note quality and run baseline predictive models on both the tabular and textual data. The SimSUM dataset is primarily designed to support research on clinical information extraction in the presence of tabular background variables, which can be linked through domain knowledge to concepts of interest to be extracted from the text (symptoms, in the case of SimSUM). Secondary uses include research on the automation of clinical reasoning over both tabular data and text, causal effect estimation in the presence of tabular and/or textual confounders, and multi-modal synthetic data generation.

Despite their potential, the scarcity of publicly available DEL datasets presents a bottleneck for the advancement of machine learning methodologies in this domain. To address this gap, we introduce KinDEL, one of the largest publicly accessible DEL datasets and the first one that includes binding poses from molecular docking experiments. Focused on two kinases, Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 14 (MAPK14) and Discoidin Domain Receptor Tyrosine Kinase 1 (DDR1), KinDEL includes 81 million compounds, offering a rich resource for computational exploration. Additionally, we provide comprehensive biophysical assay validation data, encompassing both on-DNA and off-DNA measurements, which we use to evaluate a suite of machine learning techniques, including novel structure-based probabilistic models. We hope that our benchmark, encompassing both 2D and 3D structures, will help advance the development of machine learning models for data-driven hit identification using DELs."

In this paper, we propose Feature-level constrained Preference Optimization (FPO), a novel method designed to simplify the alignment process while ensuring stability. FPO leverages pre-trained Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and introduces feature-level constraints, allowing for efficient, sparsity-enforced alignment. Our approach enjoys efficiency by using sparse features activated in a well-trained sparse autoencoder and the quality of sequential KL divergence by using the feature-level offline reference. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that FPO achieves a 5.08% absolute improvement in win rate with much lower computational cost compared to state-of-the-art baselines, making it a promising solution for efficient and controllable LLM alignments."

However, traditional breath-held imaging protocols pose challenges for patients with arrhythmias or limited breath-holding capacity. This work aims to overcome these limitations by developing a reconstruction framework that enables high-quality imaging in free-breathing conditions for various dynamic cardiac MRI protocols. Multi-Dynamic Deep Image Prior (M-DIP), a novel unsupervised reconstruction framework for accelerated real-time cardiac MRI, is introduced. To capture contrast or content variation, M-DIP first employs a spatial dictionary to synthesize a time-dependent intermediate image. Then, this intermediate image is further refined using time-dependent deformation fields that model cardiac and respiratory motion. Unlike prior DIP-based methods, M-DIP simultaneously captures physiological motion and frame-to-frame content variations, making it applicable to a wide range of dynamic applications. We validate M-DIP using simulated MRXCAT cine phantom data as well as free-breathing real-time cine, single-shot late gadolinium enhancement (LGE), and first-pass perfusion data from clinical patients. Comparative analyses against state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised approaches demonstrate M-DIP's performance and versatility. M-DIP achieved better image quality metrics on phantom data, higher reader scores on in-vivo cine and LGE data, and comparable scores on in-vivo perfusion data relative to another DIP-based approach. M-DIP enables high-quality reconstructions of real-time free-breathing cardiac MRI without requiring external training data. Its ability to model physiological motion and content variations makes it a promising approach for various dynamic imaging applications."

However, current methods rely on finetuned Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which are costly to train and update, and exhibit poor generalizability. This latter issue is of particular concern, as: 1) finetuning narrows the pretrained distribution of MLLMs, thereby reducing generalizability; and 2) I-TIR introduces increasing query diversity and complexity. As a result, I-TIR solutions are highly likely to encounter queries and images not well represented in any training dataset. To address this, we propose leveraging Diffusion Models (DMs) for text-to-image mapping, to avoid finetuning MLLMs while preserving robust performance on complex queries. Specifically, we introduce Diffusion Augmented Retrieval (DAR), a framework that generates multiple intermediate representations via LLM-based dialogue refinements and DMs, producing a richer depiction of the user's information needs. This augmented representation facilitates more accurate identification of semantically and visually related images. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks show that for simple queries, DAR achieves results on par with finetuned I-TIR models, yet without incurring their tuning overhead. Moreover, as queries become more complex through additional conversational turns, DAR surpasses finetuned I-TIR models by up to 7.61% in Hits@10 after ten turns, illustrating its improved generalization for more intricate queries."

To address this, we introduce User-Sticker, a dataset that includes temporal and user anonymous ID across conversations. It is the largest publicly available sticker dataset to date, containing 22K unique users, 370K stickers, and 8.3M messages. The raw data was collected from a popular messaging platform from 67 conversations over 720 hours of crawling. All text and image data were carefully vetted for safety and privacy checks and modifications. Spanning 10 domains, the U-Sticker dataset captures rich temporal, multilingual, and cross-domain behaviors not previously available in other datasets. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate U-Sticker's practical applications in user behavior modeling and personalized recommendation and highlight its potential to further research areas in personalized retrieval and conversational studies.

Despite significant advances in AI and robotics, enabling machines to understand and simulate hand-object interactions, capturing the semantics of functional grasping tasks remains a considerable challenge. While previous work can generate stable and correct 3D grasps, they are still far from achieving functional grasps due to unconsidered grasp semantics. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative two-stage framework, Functional Grasp Synthesis Net (FGS-Net), for generating 3D HOI driven by functional text. This framework consists of a text-guided 3D model generator, Functional Grasp Generator (FGG), and a pose optimization strategy, Functional Grasp Refiner (FGR). FGG generates 3D models of hands and objects based on text input, while FGR fine-tunes the poses using Object Pose Approximator and energy functions to ensure the relative position between the hand and object aligns with human intent and remains physically plausible. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves precise and high-quality HOI generation without requiring additional 3D annotation data."

They are finding an increasing range of applications; however, as with other modern machine learning techniques, their theoretical understanding is limited. GNNs can encounter difficulties in gathering information from nodes that are far apart by iterated aggregation steps. This situation is partly caused by so-called oversmoothing; and overcoming it is one of the practically motivated challenges. We consider the situation where information is aggregated by multiple steps of convolution, leading to graph convolutional networks (GCNs). We analyze the generalization performance of a basic GCN, trained for node classification on data generated by the contextual stochastic block model. We predict its asymptotic performance by deriving the free energy of the problem, using the replica method, in the high-dimensional limit. Calling depth the number of convolutional steps, we show the importance of going to large depth to approach the Bayes-optimality. We detail how the architecture of the GCN has to scale with the depth to avoid oversmoothing. The resulting large depth limit can be close to the Bayes-optimality and leads to a continuous GCN. Technically, we tackle this continuous limit via an approach that resembles dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) with constraints at the initial and final times. An expansion around large regularization allows us to solve the corresponding equations for the performance of the deep GCN. This promising tool may contribute to the analysis of further deep neural networks."

While its cubic computational complexity can already be prohibitive, in modern applications, even storing the matrices themselves can pose a memory bottleneck. To address this, we derive a novel hierarchical algorithm based on block-wise computation of the LDL decomposition for large-scale log-determinant calculation in memory-constrained settings. In extreme cases where matrices are highly ill-conditioned, accurately computing the full matrix itself may be infeasible. This is particularly relevant when considering kernel matrices at scale, including the empirical Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) of neural networks trained on large datasets. Under the assumption of neural scaling laws in the test error, we show that the ratio of pseudo-determinants satisfies a power-law relationship, allowing us to derive corresponding scaling laws. This enables accurate estimation of NTK log-determinants from a tiny fraction of the full dataset; in our experiments, this results in a $\\sim$100,000$\\times$ speedup with improved accuracy over competing approximations. Using these techniques, we successfully estimate log-determinants for dense matrices of extreme sizes, which were previously deemed intractable and inaccessible due to their enormous scale and computational demands."

In this work, we provide a modern answer to this old problem. Using recent ideas from performative prediction and outcome indistinguishability, we establish that one can always efficiently predict social events accurately, regardless of how predictions influence data. While achievable, we also show that these predictions are often undesirable, highlighting the limitations of previous desiderata. We end with a discussion of various avenues forward."

This paper synthesizes existing research and presents novel experiment designs that explore how LLM-based rankers and assistants influence LLM-based judges. We provide the first empirical evidence of LLM judges exhibiting significant bias towards LLM-based rankers. Furthermore, we observe limitations in LLM judges' ability to discern subtle system performance differences. Contrary to some previous findings, our preliminary study does not find evidence of bias against AI-generated content. These results highlight the need for a more holistic view of the LLM-driven information ecosystem.

For example, KGoT achieves a 29% improvement in task success rates on the GAIA benchmark compared to Hugging Face Agents with GPT-4o mini. Moreover, harnessing a smaller model dramatically reduces operational costs by over 36x compared to GPT-4o. Improvements for other models (e.g., Qwen2.5-32B and Deepseek-R1-70B) and benchmarks (e.g., SimpleQA) are similar.

As a result, there is growing interest in exploiting parameter transferability, where parameter sets optimized for one problem instance are transferred to another that could be more complex either to estimate the solution or to serve as a warm start for further optimization. But can we transfer parameters from one class of problems to another? Leveraging parameter sets learned from a well-studied class of problems could help navigate the less studied one, reducing optimization overhead and mitigating performance pitfalls. In this paper, we study whether pretrained QAOA parameters of MaxCut can be used as is or to warm start the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) circuits. Specifically, we design machine learning models to find good donor candidates optimized on MaxCut and apply their parameters to MIS acceptors. Our experimental results show that such parameter transfer can significantly reduce the number of optimization iterations required while achieving comparable approximation ratios."

Thus, they suffer from suboptimal performance and lack of robustness and generalization. We introduce EditLord, a code editing framework that makes the code transformation steps explicit. Our key insight is to employ a language model (LM) as an inductive learner to extract code editing rules from the training code pairs as concise meta-rule sets. Such rule sets will be manifested for each training sample to augment them for finetuning or assist in prompting- and iterative-based code editing. EditLord outperforms the state-of-the-art by an average of 22.7% in editing performance and 58.1% in robustness while achieving 20.2% higher functional correctness across critical software engineering and security applications, LM models, and editing modes."

Furthermore, the communication itself uses many streaming multiprocessors (SMs), adding to the overhead.\n  We present TokenWeave to address these challenges. TokenWeave proposes a Token-Splitting technique that divides the tokens in the inference batch into two approximately equal subsets in a wave-aware manner. The communication of one subset is then overlapped with the computation of the other. In addition, TokenWeave optimizes the order of the layer normalization computation with respect to communication operations and implements a novel fused AllReduce--RMSNorm kernel that carefully leverages Multimem instruction support available on NVIDIA Hopper GPUs. These optimizations allow TokenWeave to perform communication and RMSNorm using only 2-8 SMs. Moreover, our kernel enables the memory-bound RMSNorm to be overlapped with the other batch's computation, providing additional gains.\n  Our evaluations demonstrate up to 1.29x speedup in latency and 1.26x higher throughput across multiple models and workloads. In several settings, TokenWeave results in better performance compared to an equivalent model with all communication removed."

Here, we introduce the first framework to capture offensive and defensive cyber-capabilities in evolving real-world systems. Instantiating this framework with BountyBench, we set up 25 systems with complex, real-world codebases. To capture the vulnerability lifecycle, we define three task types: Detect (detecting a new vulnerability), Exploit (exploiting a specific vulnerability), and Patch (patching a specific vulnerability). For Detect, we construct a new success indicator, which is general across vulnerability types and provides localized evaluation. We manually set up the environment for each system, including installing packages, setting up server(s), and hydrating database(s). We add 40 bug bounties, which are vulnerabilities with monetary awards of \\$10-\\$30,485, covering 9 of the OWASP Top 10 Risks. To modulate task difficulty, we devise a new strategy based on information to guide detection, interpolating from identifying a zero day to exploiting a specific vulnerability.

Given up to three attempts, the top-performing agents are OpenAI Codex CLI: o3-high (12.5% on Detect, mapping to \\$3,720; 90% on Patch, mapping to \\$14,152), Custom Agent with Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking (67.5% on Exploit), and OpenAI Codex CLI: o4-mini (90% on Patch, mapping to \\$14,422).

However, these datasets often contain some low-quality or contaminated data, to which many learning procedures are sensitive. Therefore, the question of whether and how public datasets should be prefiltered to facilitate accurate downstream learning arises. On a technical level this requires the construction of principled data prefiltering methods which are learner-agnostic robust, in the sense of provably protecting a set of pre-specified downstream learners from corrupted data. In this work, we formalize the problem of Learner-Agnostic Robust data Prefiltering (LARP), which aims at finding prefiltering procedures that minimize a worst-case loss over a pre-specified set of learners. We first instantiate our framework in the context of scalar mean estimation with Huber estimators under the Huber data contamination model. We provide a hardness result on a specific problem instance and analyze several natural prefiltering procedures. Our theoretical results indicate that performing LARP on a heterogeneous set of learners leads to some loss in model performance compared to the alternative of prefiltering data for each learner/use-case individually. We explore the resulting utility loss and its dependence on the problem parameters via extensive experiments on real-world image and tabular data, observing statistically significant reduction in utility. Finally, we model the trade-off between the utility drop and the cost of repeated (learner-specific) prefiltering within a game-theoretic framework and showcase benefits of LARP for large datasets."

Here, we find that the answer depends in a surprising way on the distribution of the treatment noise. Focusing on the partially linear model of \\citet{robinson1988root}, we first show that the widely adopted double machine learning (DML) estimator is minimax rate-optimal for Gaussian treatment noise, resolving an open problem of \\citet{mackey2018orthogonal}. Meanwhile, for independent non-Gaussian treatment noise, we show that DML is always suboptimal by constructing new practical procedures with higher-order robustness to nuisance errors. These \\emph{ACE} procedures use structure-agnostic cumulant estimators to achieve $r$-th order insensitivity to nuisance errors whenever the $(r+1)$-st treatment cumulant is non-zero. We complement these core results with novel minimax guarantees for binary treatments in the partially linear model.

However, existing algorithms always suffer from high memory overhead and bias towards recently trained tasks. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a novel online continual learning approach termed as SESLR, which incorporates a sleep enhanced latent replay scheme with spiking neural networks (SNNs). SESLR leverages SNNs' binary spike characteristics to store replay features in single bits, significantly reducing memory overhead. Furthermore, inspired by biological sleep-wake cycles, SESLR introduces a noise-enhanced sleep phase where the model exclusively trains on replay samples with controlled noise injection, effectively mitigating classification bias towards new classes. Extensive experiments on both conventional (MNIST, CIFAR10) and neuromorphic (NMNIST, CIFAR10-DVS) datasets demonstrate SESLR's effectiveness. On Split CIFAR10, SESLR achieves nearly 30% improvement in average accuracy with only one-third of the memory consumption compared to baseline methods. On Split CIFAR10-DVS, it improves accuracy by approximately 10% while reducing memory overhead by a factor of 32. These results validate SESLR as a promising solution for online continual learning in resource-constrained edge computing scenarios."

To address these limitations, we propose a novel hybrid-view attention (HVA) network for csPCa classification in 3D TRUS that leverages complementary information from transverse and sagittal views. Our approach integrates a CNN-transformer hybrid architecture, where convolutional layers extract fine-grained local features and transformer-based HVA models global dependencies. Specifically, the HVA comprises intra-view attention to refine features within a single view and cross-view attention to incorporate complementary information across views. Furthermore, a hybrid-view adaptive fusion module dynamically aggregates features along both channel and spatial dimensions, enhancing the overall representation. Experiments are conducted on an in-house dataset containing 590 subjects who underwent prostate biopsy. Comparative and ablation results prove the efficacy of our method.

Standard diffusion models achieve high-quality image reconstruction but require a large number of sampling steps during inference, resulting in substantial computational overhead. Although skip-sampling strategies have been proposed to improve efficiency, they often lead to loss of fine structural details. To address this issue, we propose a prior information embedding and wavelet feature fusion fast sampling diffusion model for LACT reconstruction. The PWD enables efficient sampling while preserving reconstruction fidelity in LACT, and effectively mitigates the degradation typically introduced by skip-sampling. Specifically, during the training phase, PWD maps the distribution of LACT images to that of fully sampled target images, enabling the model to learn structural correspondences between them. During inference, the LACT image serves as an explicit prior to guide the sampling trajectory, allowing for high-quality reconstruction with significantly fewer steps. In addition, PWD performs multi-scale feature fusion in the wavelet domain, effectively enhancing the reconstruction of fine details by leveraging both low-frequency and high-frequency information. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on clinical dental arch CBCT and periapical datasets demonstrate that PWD outperforms existing methods under the same sampling condition. Using only 50 sampling steps, PWD achieves at least 1.7 dB improvement in PSNR and 10% gain in SSIM."

Previous work has been devoted to address the trade-off obstacle of balancing the consistency (near-optimality under accurate predictions) and robustness (bounded inefficiency under poor predictions) primarily in the unweighted setting, assuming that all agents have the same importance. However, this assumption may not be true in some practical scenarios, leading to research of weighted facility location problems.\n  The major contribution of the current work is to provide a prediction augmented algorithmic framework for balancing the consistency and robustness over strategic agents with non-uniform weights.

While effective at reducing latency, this approach demands more hardware. To improve GPU utilization, Chunked Prefill mixes prefill and decode requests within the same batch, but introduces phase interference between prefill and decode.\n  While existing PD disaggregation solutions separate the phases across GPUs, we ask: can the same decoupling be achieved within a single serving engine? The key challenge lies in managing the conflicting resource requirements of prefill and decode when they share the same hardware. In this paper, we first show that chunked prefill requests cause interference with decode requests due to their distinct requirements for GPU resources. Second, we find that GPU resources exhibit diminishing returns. Beyond a saturation point, increasing GPU allocation yields negligible latency improvements. This insight enables us to split a single GPU's resources and dynamically allocate them to prefill and decode on the fly, effectively disaggregating the two phases within the same GPU.\n  Across a range of models and workloads, our system Nexus achieves up to 2.2x higher throughput, 20x lower TTFT, and 2.5x lower TBT than vLLM. It also outperforms SGLang with up to 2x higher throughput, 2x lower TTFT, and 1.7x lower TBT, and achieves 1.4x higher throughput than vLLM-disaggregation using only half the number of GPUs."

To overcome these limitations, we introduce Cross-Instance Audio-Visual Localization (CI-AVL), a novel task that leverages images from different instances of the same sound event category to localize target sound sources, thereby reducing dependence on paired data while enhancing generalization capabilities. Our proposed VP-SelDoA tackles this challenging task through a semantic-level modality fusion and employs a Frequency-Temporal ConMamba architecture to generate target-selective masks for sound isolation. We further develop a Semantic-Spatial Matching mechanism that aligns the heterogeneous semantic and spatial features via integrated cross- and self-attention mechanisms.

Although existing technologies have made progress in reconstructing the mel spectrograms of auditory stimuli at the word or letter level, there remain core challenges in the precise reconstruction of minute-level continuous imagined speech: traditional models struggle to balance the efficiency of temporal dependency modeling and information retention in long-sequence decoding. To address this issue, this paper proposes the Dynamic Multiscale Fusion Network (DMF2Mel), which consists of four core components: the Dynamic Contrastive Feature Aggregation Module (DC-FAM), the Hierarchical Attention-Guided Multi-Scale Network (HAMS-Net), the SplineMap attention mechanism, and the bidirectional state space module (convMamba). Specifically, the DC-FAM separates speech-related \"foreground features\" from noisy \"background features\" through local convolution and global attention mechanisms, effectively suppressing interference and enhancing the representation of transient signals. HAMS-Net, based on the U-Net framework,achieves cross-scale fusion of high-level semantics and low-level details. The SplineMap attention mechanism integrates the Adaptive Gated Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (AGKAN) to combine global context modeling with spline-based local fitting. The convMamba captures long-range temporal dependencies with linear complexity and enhances nonlinear dynamic modeling capabilities. Results on the SparrKULee dataset show that DMF2Mel achieves a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.074 in mel spectrogram reconstruction for known subjects (a 48% improvement over the baseline) and 0.048 for unknown subjects (a 35% improvement over the baseline).Code is available at: https://github.com/fchest/DMF2Mel."

Conventionally, to ensure the speech enhancement performs optimally, the speech enhancement has needed to be tuned for each task. Thus, generalizing speech enhancement models to unknown downstream tasks has been challenging. This study aims to construct a generic speech enhancement front-end that can improve the performance of back-ends to solve multiple downstream tasks. To this end, we propose a novel training criterion that minimizes the distance between the enhanced and the ground truth clean signal in the feature representation domain of self-supervised learning models. Since self-supervised learning feature representations effectively express high-level speech information useful for solving various downstream tasks, the proposal is expected to make speech enhancement models preserve such information. Experimental validation demonstrates that the proposal improves the performance of multiple speech tasks while maintaining the perceptual quality of the enhanced signal."

Recent results from audio (music and speech) quality assessment as well as image similarity have shown that deep learning is able to produce embeddings that align well with human perception while being largely free from these constraints. Although the existing human-rated timbre similarity data is not large enough to train deep neural networks (2,614 pairwise ratings on 334 audio samples), it can serve as test-only data for audio models. In this paper, we introduce metrics to assess the alignment of diverse audio representations with human judgments of timbre similarity by comparing both the absolute values and the rankings of embedding distances to human similarity ratings. Our evaluation involves three signal-processing-based representations, twelve representations extracted from pre-trained models, and three representations extracted from a novel sound matching model. Among them, the style embeddings inspired by image style transfer, extracted from the CLAP model and the sound matching model, remarkably outperform the others, showing their potential in modeling timbre similarity."

Nevertheless, annotating such data manually is expensive, making it challenging to train machine learning models for recognition purposes. To this end, we propose applying semi-supervised learning to incorporate a large scale of unlabelled data alongside a relatively smaller set of labelled data. We train end-to-end acoustic and linguistic models, each employing multi-task learning for emotion and intent recognition. Two semi-supervised learning approaches, including fix-match learning and full-match learning, are compared. The experimental results demonstrate that the semi-supervised learning approaches improve model performance in speech emotion and intent recognition from both acoustic and text data. The late fusion of the best models outperforms the acoustic and text baselines by joint recognition balance metrics of 12.3% and 10.4%, respectively."

We propose a simple, post-hoc framework to address this by modifying the bottleneck of a pre-trained autoencoder. Our method introduces a \"Re-Bottleneck\", an inner bottleneck trained exclusively through latent space losses to instill user-defined structure. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in three experiments. First, we enforce an ordering on latent channels without sacrificing reconstruction quality. Second, we align latents with semantic embeddings, analyzing the impact on downstream diffusion modeling. Third, we introduce equivariance, ensuring that a filtering operation on the input waveform directly corresponds to a specific transformation in the latent space. Ultimately, our Re-Bottleneck framework offers a flexible and efficient way to tailor representations of neural audio models, enabling them to seamlessly meet the varied demands of different applications with minimal additional training."

Quantization, particularly Post-Training Quantization (PTQ), offers an effective way to reduce model size and inference cost without retraining. Despite its importance, the performance implications of various advanced quantization methods and bit-width configurations on ASR models remain unclear. In this work, we present a comprehensive benchmark of eight state-of-the-art (SOTA) PTQ methods applied to two leading edge-ASR model families, Whisper and Moonshine. We systematically evaluate model performances (i.e., accuracy, memory I/O and bit operations) across seven diverse datasets from the open ASR leaderboard, analyzing the impact of quantization and various configurations on both weights and activations. Built on an extension of the LLM compression toolkit, our framework integrates edge-ASR models, diverse advanced quantization algorithms, a unified calibration and evaluation data pipeline, and detailed analysis tools.

Two key challenges hinder progress: (1) the high computational overhead during training caused by multi-timestep spike firing, and (2) the absence of large-scale SNN architectures tailored to speech processing tasks. To overcome the issues, we introduce Input-aware Multi-Level Spikeformer, i.e. IML-Spikeformer, a spiking Transformer architecture specifically designed for large-scale speech processing. Central to our design is the Input-aware Multi-Level Spike (IMLS) mechanism, which simulate multi-timestep spike firing within a single timestep using an adaptive, input-aware thresholding scheme. IML-Spikeformer further integrates a Reparameterized Spiking Self-Attention (RepSSA) module with a Hierarchical Decay Mask (HDM), forming the HD-RepSSA module. This module enhances the precision of attention maps and enables modeling of multi-scale temporal dependencies in speech signals. Experiments demonstrate that IML-Spikeformer achieves word error rates of 6.0\\% on AiShell-1 and 3.4\\% on Librispeech-960, comparable to conventional ANN transformers while reducing theoretical inference energy consumption by 4.64$\\times$ and 4.32$\\times$ respectively.

Compared to text-based interaction, edge ASR-LLM allows accessible and natural audio interactions. Unfortunately, existing ASR-LLM models are mainly trained in high-performance computing environments and produce substantial model weights, making them difficult to deploy on edge devices. More importantly, to better serve users' personalized needs, the ASR-LLM must be able to learn from each distinct user, given that audio input often contains highly personalized characteristics that necessitate personalized on-device training. Since individually fine-tuning the ASR or LLM often leads to suboptimal results due to modality-specific limitations, end-to-end training ensures seamless integration of audio features and language understanding (cross-modal alignment), ultimately enabling a more personalized and efficient adaptation on edge devices. However, due to the complex training requirements and substantial computational demands of existing approaches, cross-modal alignment between ASR audio and LLM can be challenging on edge devices.

To address this, we propose Inter-linguistic Phonetic Composition (IPC), a novel computational method designed to minimize incorrect phonological transfer by reconstructing L2 phonemes as composite sounds derived from multiple L1 phonemes. Tests with two automatic speech recognition models demonstrated that when L2 speakers produced IPC-generated composite sounds, the recognition rate of target L2 phonemes improved by 20% compared to when their pronunciation was influenced by original phonological transfer patterns. The improvement was observed within a relatively shorter time frame, demonstrating rapid acquisition of the composite sound."

        "summary": "arXiv:2412.18603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: We consider the generative modeling of speech over multiple minutes, a requirement for long-form multimedia generation and audio-native voice assistants. However, textless spoken language models struggle to generate plausible speech past tens of seconds, due to high temporal resolution of speech tokens causing loss of coherence, architectural issues with long-sequence training or extrapolation, and memory costs at inference time. From these considerations we derive SpeechSSM, the first speech language model family to learn from and sample long-form spoken audio (e.g., 16 minutes of read or extemporaneous speech) in a single decoding session without text intermediates. SpeechSSMs leverage recent advances in linear-time sequence modeling to greatly surpass current Transformer spoken LMs in coherence and efficiency on multi-minute generations while still matching them at the utterance level. As we found current spoken language evaluations uninformative, especially in this new long-form setting, we also introduce: LibriSpeech-Long, a benchmark for long-form speech evaluation; new embedding-based and LLM-judged metrics; and quality measurements over length and time. Speech samples, the LibriSpeech-Long dataset, and any future code or model releases can be found at https://google.github.io/tacotron/publications/speechssm/."

        "summary": "arXiv:2502.00718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: The rise of multimodal large language models has introduced innovative human-machine interaction paradigms but also significant challenges in machine learning safety. Audio-Language Models (ALMs) are especially relevant due to the intuitive nature of spoken communication, yet little is known about their failure modes. This paper explores audio jailbreaks targeting ALMs, focusing on their ability to bypass alignment mechanisms. We construct adversarial perturbations that generalize across prompts, tasks, and even base audio samples, demonstrating the first universal jailbreaks in the audio modality, and show that these remain effective in simulated real-world conditions. Beyond demonstrating attack feasibility, we analyze how ALMs interpret these audio adversarial examples and reveal them to encode imperceptible first-person toxic speech - suggesting that the most effective perturbations for eliciting toxic outputs specifically embed linguistic features within the audio signal. These results have important implications for understanding the interactions between different modalities in multimodal models, and offer actionable insights for enhancing defenses against adversarial audio attacks."

Existing work has shown that a range of linguistic features can be successfully decoded from end-to-end models trained only on speech recordings. However, it's less clear to what extent pre-training on specific languages improves language-specific linguistic information. Here we test the encoding of Dutch phonetic and lexical information in internal representations of self-supervised Wav2Vec2 models. Pre-training exclusively on Dutch improves the representation of Dutch linguistic features as compared to pre-training on similar amounts of English or larger amounts of multilingual data. This language-specific advantage is well-detected by trained clustering or classification probes, and partially observable using zero-shot metrics. Furthermore, the language-specific benefit on linguistic feature encoding aligns with downstream performance on Automatic Speech Recognition."

        "summary": "arXiv:2506.15220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Videos contain a wealth of information, and generating detailed and accurate descriptions in natural language is a key aspect of video understanding. In this paper, we present video-SALMONN 2, an advanced audio-visual large language model (LLM) with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) designed for enhanced video (with paired audio) captioning through directed preference optimisation (DPO). We propose new metrics to evaluate the completeness and accuracy of video descriptions, which are optimised using DPO. To further improve training, we propose a novel multi-round DPO (MrDPO) approach, which involves periodically updating the DPO reference model, merging and re-initialising the LoRA module as a proxy for parameter updates after each training round (1,000 steps), and incorporating guidance from ground-truth video captions to stabilise the process. Experimental results show that MrDPO significantly enhances video-SALMONN 2's captioning accuracy, reducing the captioning error rates by 28\\%. The final video-SALMONN 2 model, with just 7 billion parameters, surpasses leading models such as GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro in video captioning tasks, while maintaining highly competitive performance to the state-of-the-art on widely used video question-answering benchmarks among models of similar size.
