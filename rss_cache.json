These breakthroughs have been driven by large-scale reinforcement learning (RL), particularly when combined with verifiable reward signals that provide objective and grounded supervision. In this report, we investigate the effects of prolonged reinforcement learning on a small language model across a diverse set of reasoning domains. Our work identifies several key ingredients for effective training, including the use of verifiable reward tasks, enhancements to Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), and practical techniques to improve training stability and generalization. We introduce controlled KL regularization, clipping ratio, and periodic reference policy resets as critical components for unlocking long-term performance gains. Our model achieves significant improvements over strong baselines, including +14.7% on math, +13.9% on coding, and +54.8% on logic puzzle tasks. To facilitate continued research, we release our model publicly."

However, state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) struggle frequently with tasks as simple as anticipating how a scene will look after an egocentric motion: they perceive 2D images but lack an internal model of 3D dynamics. We therefore propose MindJourney, a test-time scaling framework that grants a VLM with this missing capability by coupling it to a controllable world model based on video diffusion. The VLM iteratively sketches a concise camera trajectory, while the world model synthesizes the corresponding view at each step. The VLM then reasons over this multi-view evidence gathered during the interactive exploration. Without any fine-tuning, our MindJourney achieves over an average 8% performance boost on the representative spatial reasoning benchmark SAT, showing that pairing VLMs with world models for test-time scaling offers a simple, plug-and-play route to robust 3D reasoning. Meanwhile, our method also improves upon the test-time inference VLMs trained through reinforcement learning, which demonstrates the potential of our method that utilizes world models for test-time scaling."

What permits us to draw in globally relevant information and reason over it coherently? Here, we explore the hypothesis that people use a combination of distributed and symbolic representations to construct bespoke mental models tailored to novel situations. We propose a computational implementation of this idea -- a ``Model Synthesis Architecture'' (MSA) -- using language models to implement global relevance-based retrieval and model synthesis and probabilistic programs to implement bespoke, coherent world models. We evaluate our MSA as a model of human judgments on a novel reasoning dataset. The dataset -- built around a `Model Olympics` domain of sports vignettes -- tests models' capacity for human-like, open-ended reasoning by requiring (i) judgments about novel causal structures described in language; (ii) drawing on large bodies of background knowledge; and (iii) doing both in light of observations that introduce arbitrary novel variables. Our MSA approach captures human judgments better than language model-only baselines, under both direct and chain-of-thought generations from the LM that supports model synthesis. These results suggest that MSAs can be implemented in a way that mirrors people's ability to deliver locally coherent reasoning over globally relevant variables, offering a path to understanding and replicating human reasoning in open-ended domains."

Drawing from complexity theory, we formalize this distinction and demonstrate that current parallel-centric architectures face fundamental limitations on such tasks.

In order to reliably accomplish these tasks, LMs must be able to discern the modal category of a sentence (i.e., whether it describes something that is possible, impossible, completely nonsensical, etc.). However, recent studies have called into question the ability of LMs to categorize sentences according to modality (Michaelov et al., 2025; Kauf et al., 2023). In this work, we identify linear representations that discriminate between modal categories within a variety of LMs, or modal difference vectors. Analysis of modal difference vectors reveals that LMs have access to more reliable modal categorization judgments than previously reported. Furthermore, we find that modal difference vectors emerge in a consistent order as models become more competent (i.e., through training steps, layers, and parameter count). Notably, we find that modal difference vectors identified within LM activations can be used to model fine-grained human categorization behavior. This potentially provides a novel view into how human participants distinguish between modal categories, which we explore by correlating projections along modal difference vectors with human participants' ratings of interpretable features. In summary, we derive new insights into LM modal categorization using techniques from mechanistic interpretability, with the potential to inform our understanding of modal categorization in humans."

However, they struggle with integrating knowledge across multiple domains, unlike humans.\n  Mental imagery plays a fundamental role in the brain's thinking process, which involves performing tasks based on internal multisensory data, planned actions, needs, and reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we investigate how to integrate mental imagery into a machine thinking framework and how this could be beneficial in initiating the thinking process. Our proposed machine thinking framework integrates a Cognitive thinking unit supported by three auxiliary units: the Input Data Unit, the Needs Unit, and the Mental Imagery Unit. Within this framework, data is represented as natural language sentences or drawn sketches, serving both informative and decision-making purposes. We conducted validation tests for this framework, and the results are presented and discussed."

        "summary": "arXiv:2507.12566v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This paper focuses on monolithic Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which integrate visual encoding and language decoding into a single model. Existing structures and pre-training strategies for monolithic MLLMs often suffer from unstable optimization and catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, our key idea is to embed a new visual parameter space into a pre-trained LLM, enabling stable learning of visual knowledge from noisy data via delta tuning. Based on this principle, we first introduce Mono-InternVL, an advanced monolithic MLLM that incorporates a set of visual experts through a multimodal mixture-of-experts architecture. In addition, we design an innovative Endogenous Visual Pre-training (EViP) for Mono-InternVL to maximize its visual capabilities via progressive learning. Mono-InternVL achieves competitive performance against existing MLLMs but also leads to relatively expensive data cost. Therefore, we further present Mono-InternVL-1.5, a cheaper and stronger monolithic MLLM equipped with an improved EViP (EViP++). EViP++ introduces additional visual attention experts to Mono-InternVL-1.5 and re-organizes the pre-training process in an efficient manner. During inference, it includes a fused CUDA kernel to speed up its MoE operations. With these designs, Mono-InternVL-1.5 significantly reduces training and inference costs, while still maintaining competitive performance with Mono-InternVL. To evaluate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments across 15 benchmarks. Results demonstrate that Mono-InternVL outperforms existing monolithic MLLMs on 12 out of 15 benchmarks, e.g., +114-point improvement over Emu3 on OCRBench. Compared to its modular counterpart, i.e., InternVL-1.5, Mono-InternVL-1.5 achieves similar multimodal performance while reducing first-token latency by up to 69%.

One of them is concept drift, which is characterized by the change in data distribution over time. Among many approaches explored in literature, the fusion of classifiers has been showing good results and is getting growing attention. DS methods, due to the ensemble being instance-based, seem to be an efficient choice under drifting scenarios. However, some attention must be paid to adapting such methods for concept drift. The training must be done in order to create local experts, and the commonly used neighborhood-search DS may become prohibitive with the continuous arrival of data. In this work, we propose IncA-DES, which employs a training strategy that promotes the generation of local experts with the assumption that different regions of the feature space become available with time. Additionally, the fusion of a concept drift detector supports the maintenance of information and adaptation to a new concept. An overlap-based classification filter is also employed in order to avoid using the DS method when there is a consensus in the neighborhood, a strategy that we argue every DS method should employ, as it was shown to make them more applicable and quicker. Moreover, aiming to reduce the processing time of the kNN, we propose an Online K-d tree algorithm, which can quickly remove instances without becoming inconsistent and deals with unbalancing concerns that may occur in data streams. Experimental results showed that the proposed framework got the best average accuracy compared to seven state-of-the-art methods considering different levels of label availability and presented the smaller processing time between the most accurate methods. Additionally, the fusion with the Online K-d tree has improved processing time with a negligible loss in accuracy. We have made our framework available in an online repository."

Specifically, we focus on the k-centroids ranking vectors clustering problem (KRC), which aims to partition a set of ranking vectors into k clusters and identify the centroid of each cluster. Unlike classical k-means clustering (KMC), KRC constrains both the observations and centroids to be ranking vectors. We establish the NP-hardness of KRC and characterize its feasible set. For the single-cluster case, we derive a closed-form analytical solution for the optimal centroid, which can be computed in linear time. To address the computational challenges of KRC, we develop an efficient approximation algorithm, KRCA, which iteratively refines initial solutions from KMC, referred to as the baseline solution. Additionally, we introduce a branch-and-bound (BnB) algorithm for efficient cluster reconstruction within KRCA, leveraging a decision tree framework to reduce computational time while incorporating a controlling parameter to balance solution quality and efficiency. We establish theoretical error bounds for KRCA and BnB. Through extensive numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that KRCA consistently outperforms baseline solutions, delivering significant improvements in solution quality with fast computational times. This work highlights the practical significance of KRC for personalization and large-scale decision making, offering methodological advancements and insights that can be built upon in future studies."

Such a result is often called a first-order bound. For $[0,1]$-valued regression, we first show that the log loss minimizer leads to a similar first-order bound. We then ask if there exists a loss function that achieves a variance-dependent bound (also known as a second order bound), which is a strict improvement upon first-order bounds. We answer this question in the affirmative by proposing a novel loss function called the betting loss.

This study presents the first comprehensive review of large-scale, pixel-wise crop mapping workflows, encompassing both conventional supervised methods and emerging transfer learning approaches. To identify the optimal supervised crop mapping workflows, we conducted systematic experiments, comparing six widely adopted satellite image-based preprocessing methods, alongside eleven supervised pixel-wise classification models. Additionally, we assessed the synergistic impact of varied training sample sizes and variable combinations. Moreover, we identified optimal transfer learning techniques for different magnitudes of domain shift. The evaluation of best methods was conducted across five diverse agricultural sites. Landsat 8 served as the primary satellite data source. Labels come from CDL trusted pixels and field surveys.\n  Our findings reveal three key insights. First, fine-scale interval preprocessing paired with Transformer models consistently delivered optimal performance for both supervised and transferable workflows. RF offered rapid training and competitive performance in conventional supervised learning and direct transfer to similar domains. Second, transfer learning techniques enhanced workflow adaptability, with UDA being effective for homogeneous crop classes while fine-tuning remains robust across diverse scenarios. Finally, workflow choice depends heavily on the availability of labeled samples. With a sufficient sample size, supervised training typically delivers more accurate and generalizable results. Below a certain threshold, transfer learning that matches the level of domain shift is a viable alternative to achieve crop mapping.

However, selecting an optimal blend of task datasets remains a largely manual, heuristic driven process, with practitioners often relying on uniform or size based sampling strategies. We introduce TASKPGM, a principled and scalable framework for mixture optimization that selects continuous task proportions by minimizing an energy function over a Markov Random Field (MRF). Task relationships are modeled using behavioral divergences such as Jensen Shannon Divergence and Pointwise Mutual Information computed from the predictive distributions of single task finetuned models. Our method yields a closed form solution under simplex constraints and provably balances representativeness and diversity among tasks. We provide theoretical guarantees, including weak submodularity for budgeted variants, and demonstrate consistent empirical improvements on Llama 2 and Mistral across evaluation suites such as MMLU and BIGBench. Beyond performance, TASKPGM offers interpretable insights into task influence and mixture composition, making it a powerful tool for efficient and robust LLM finetuning."

We evaluate twenty-two backbone models across seven architecture families (MViTv2, MViTv1, SlowFast, Slow, X3D, I3D, C2D), achieving up to 63.9% accuracy in predicting shot direction (left or right), outperforming the real goalkeepers' decisions.

As with most computational software, it is important to distinguish between ordinary runtime performance and startup overhead. Prior research has focused on runtime performance: improving training efficiency and stability. This work focuses instead on the increasingly critical issue of startup overhead in training: the delay before training jobs begin execution. Startup overhead is particularly important in large, industrial-scale LLMs, where failures occur more frequently and multiple teams operate in iterative update-debug cycles. In one of our training clusters, more than 3.5% of GPU time is wasted due to startup overhead alone.\n  In this work, we present the first in-depth characterization of LLM training startup overhead based on real production data. We analyze the components of startup cost, quantify its direct impact, and examine how it scales with job size. These insights motivate the design of Bootseer, a system-level optimization framework that addresses three primary startup bottlenecks: (a) container image loading, (b) runtime dependency installation, and (c) model checkpoint resumption. To mitigate these bottlenecks, Bootseer introduces three techniques: (a) hot block record-and-prefetch, (b) dependency snapshotting, and (c) striped HDFS-FUSE. Bootseer has been deployed in a production environment and evaluated on real LLM training workloads, demonstrating a 50% reduction in startup overhead."

Since there could be an exponential number of object-action combinations, labeled data is limited - leading to a long-tail distribution problem. Recently, zero-shot learning emerged as a solution, with end-to-end transformer-based object detectors adapted for HOID becoming successful frameworks. However, their primary focus is designing improved decoders for learning entangled or disentangled interpretations of interactions. We advocate that HOI-specific cues must be anticipated at the encoder stage itself to obtain a stronger scene interpretation. Consequently, we build a top-down framework named Funnel-HOI inspired by the human tendency to grasp well-defined concepts first and then associate them with abstract concepts during scene understanding. We first probe an image for the presence of objects (well-defined concepts) and then probe for actions (abstract concepts) associated with them. A novel asymmetric co-attention mechanism mines these cues utilizing multimodal information (incorporating zero-shot capabilities) and yields stronger interaction representations at the encoder level. Furthermore, a novel loss is devised that considers objectaction relatedness and regulates misclassification penalty better than existing loss functions for guiding the interaction classifier. Extensive experiments on the HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets across fully-supervised and six zero-shot settings reveal our state-of-the-art performance, with up to 12.4% and 8.4% gains for unseen and rare HOI categories, respectively."

Prior work has succeeded in manipulating this behavior via steering vectors, but the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. In this work, we show that the emergence of backtracking in DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B is in part driven by a repurposed direction already present in base model activations. Specifically, we identify a direction in base Llama-3.1-8B's residual stream which systematically induces backtracking when used to steer the distilled reasoning model, and find that the effects of steering with this direction cannot be trivially explained by token-level attributes. We further find that this direction does not induce backtracking in the base model, suggesting that the reasoning finetuning process repurposes pre-existing representations to form new behavioral circuits. Additionally, we hypothesize that this direction is one of several which may work together to mediate backtracking. Our findings offer a compelling picture that reasoning-finetuned models repurpose pre-existing base model representations, rather than learn new capabilities from scratch."

Our approach is based on three key insights: (1) covisible pixels (that are visible in both the input and target views) can be rendered by first reconstructing the dynamic 3D scene and rendering the reconstruction from the novel-views and (2) hidden pixels in novel views can be \"inpainted\" with feed-forward 2D video diffusion models. Notably, our video inpainting diffusion model (CogNVS) can be self-supervised from 2D videos, allowing us to train it on a large corpus of in-the-wild videos. This in turn allows for (3) CogNVS to be applied zero-shot to novel test videos via test-time finetuning. We empirically verify that CogNVS outperforms almost all prior art for novel-view synthesis of dynamic scenes from monocular videos."

Federated learning (FL), a distributed, privacy-preserving learning framework, presents a promising solution, but it remains unexplored in closed-loop adaptive neural interfaces. Here, we introduce FL-based neural decoding and systematically evaluate its performance and privacy using high-dimensional electromyography signals in both open- and closed-loop scenarios. In open-loop simulations, FL significantly outperformed local learning baselines, demonstrating its potential for high-performance, privacy-conscious neural decoding. In contrast, closed-loop user studies required adapting FL methods to accommodate single-user, real-time interactions, a scenario not supported by standard FL. This modification resulted in local learning decoders surpassing the adapted FL approach in closed-loop performance, yet local learning still carried higher privacy risks. Our findings highlight a critical performance-privacy tradeoff in real-time adaptive applications and indicate the need for FL methods specifically designed for co-adaptive, single-user applications."

Recently, PINNs have gained widespread attention as a powerful framework for combining physical principles with data-driven modeling to improve prediction accuracy. Despite their successes, however, PINNs often exhibit poor extrapolation performance outside the training domain and are highly sensitive to the choice of activation functions (AFs). In this paper, we introduce a transfer learning (TL) method to improve the extrapolation capability of PINNs. Our approach applies transfer learning (TL) within an extended training domain, using only a small number of carefully selected collocation points. Additionally, we propose an adaptive AF that takes the form of a linear combination of standard AFs, which improves both the robustness and accuracy of the model. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that our method achieves an average of 40% reduction in relative L2 error and an average of 50% reduction in mean absolute error in the extrapolation domain, all without a significant increase in computational cost.

Previous studies have generally not integrated retinal microvasculature characteristics with comprehensive serum lipidomic profiles as potential indicators of CVD risk. In this study, an innovative imaging omics framework was introduced, combining retinal microvascular traits derived through deep learning based image processing with serum lipidomic data to highlight asymptomatic biomarkers of cardiovascular risk beyond the conventional lipid panel. This represents the first large scale, covariate adjusted and stratified correlation analysis conducted in a healthy population, which is essential for identifying early indicators of disease. Retinal phenotypes were quantified using automated image analysis tools, while serum lipid profiling was performed by Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography Electrospray ionization High resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC ESI HRMS). Strong, age- and sex-independent correlations were established, particularly between average artery width, vessel density, and lipid subclasses such as triacylglycerols (TAGs), diacylglycerols (DAGs), and ceramides (Cers). These associations suggest a converging mechanism of microvascular remodeling under metabolic stress. By linking detailed\n  vascular structural phenotypes to specific lipid species, this study fills a critical gap in the understanding of early CVD pathogenesis. This integration not only offers a novel perspective on microvascular metabolic associations but also presents a significant opportunity for the identification of robust, non-invasive biomarkers. Ultimately, these findings may support improved early detection, targeted prevention, and personalized approaches in cardiovascular healthcare."

Evaluation on benchmark infrastructure datasets demonstrates state-of-the-art results with an F1- score of 0.771 and a mean IoU of 0.677, significantly outperforming existing methods including U-Net, SA-UNet, and U- KAN.

To evaluate the effectiveness of such efforts, one must measure the strength of the network before and after node removal. Process P1 is considered more effective than P2 if the strength of the residual network after removing k nodes via P1 is smaller than that from P2. This leads to the central question: How should network strength be measured?\n  Existing metrics rely solely on structural properties of the graph, such as connectivity. However, in real-world scenarios, particularly in law enforcement, the perception of agents regarding network strength can differ significantly from structural assessments. These perceptions are often ignored in traditional metrics.\n  We propose a new strength metric that integrates both structural properties and human perception. Using human subject surveys, we validate our approach against existing metrics. Our metric not only aligns more closely with human judgment but also outperforms traditional methods in identifying authoritative nodes and effectively dismantling both synthetic and real-world networks."

While neural parametric models are actively studied for humans and animals, plant leaves present unique challenges due to their diverse shapes and flexible deformation. To this problem, we introduce a neural parametric model for leaves, NeuraLeaf. Capitalizing on the fact that flattened leaf shapes can be approximated as a 2D plane, NeuraLeaf disentangles the leaves' geometry into their 2D base shapes and 3D deformations. This representation allows learning from rich sources of 2D leaf image datasets for the base shapes, and also has the advantage of simultaneously learning textures aligned with the geometry. To model the 3D deformation, we propose a novel skeleton-free skinning model and create a newly captured 3D leaf dataset called DeformLeaf. We show that NeuraLeaf successfully generates a wide range of leaf shapes with deformation, resulting in accurate model fitting to 3D observations like depth maps and point clouds.

This is due to the rigidity of their subword tokenizers, which typically remain unchanged during adaptation. This inflexibility often leads to inefficient tokenization, causing overfragmentation of out-of-distribution domains, unseen languages, or scripts. In this work, we develop byte-level LMs with learnable tokenizers to make tokenization adaptive. Our models include a submodule that learns to predict boundaries between the input byte sequence, encoding it into variable-length segments. Existing tokenizer-free methods train this boundary predictor using an auxiliary loss that enforces a fixed compression rate across the training corpus, introducing a new kind of rigidity. We propose FLEXITOKENS, a simplified training objective that enables significantly greater flexibility during adaptation. Evaluating across multiple multilingual benchmarks, morphologically diverse tasks, and domains, we demonstrate that FLEXITOKENS consistently reduces token over-fragmentation and achieves up to 10\\% improvements on downstream task performance compared to subword and other gradient-based tokenizers.

Our work first investigates whether we can elicit such behavior without any training. To this end, we propose a decoding-time approach, ThinkLogit, which utilizes logits arithmetic (Liu et al., 2024) to tune a target large LM for long reasoning using a substantially smaller model as guider. We then show that we can further boost performance by training the guider model with preference optimization over correct/incorrect reasoning pairs sampled from both the target and guider model -- a setup we refer to as ThinkLogit-DPO.

To address these issues, we introduce auxiliary variables to separate the layers of deep neural networks. Specifically, the output and its derivatives of each layer are represented by auxiliary variables, effectively decomposing the deep architecture into a series of shallow architectures. New loss functions with auxiliary variables are established, in which only variables from two neighboring layers are coupled. Corresponding algorithms based on alternating directions are developed, where many variables can be updated optimally in closed forms.

Focusing on low-level linguistic abstraction, we trained our model as a byte-level language model. Our model spontaneously learns to tokenize bytes, producing fewer concept tokens than Byte-level Byte Pair Encoder (BBPE) tokenizers while keeping comparable performance. By comparing with Llama3, we observed an advantage of Synergy under the same model scale and training dataset size. Further studies show that the middle part (the higher abstraction part) of our model performs better when positional encodings are removed, suggesting the emergence of position-independent concepts. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of tokenizer-free architectures, paving the way for more robust and flexible pipelines."

Recent token merging methods improve efficiency by reducing the number of tokens during attention operations, but often overlook the characteristics of attention-based image generation models, limiting their effectiveness. In this paper, we propose local representative token guided merging (ReToM), a novel token merging strategy applicable to any attention mechanism in image generation. To merge tokens based on various contextual information, ReToM defines local boundaries as windows within attention inputs and adjusts window sizes. Furthermore, we introduce a representative token, which represents the most representative token per window by computing similarity at a specific timestep and selecting the token with the highest average similarity. This approach preserves the most salient local features while minimizing computational overhead. Experimental results show that ReToM achieves a 6.2% improvement in FID and higher CLIP scores compared to the baseline, while maintaining comparable inference time. We empirically demonstrate that ReToM is effective in balancing visual quality and computational efficiency."

These modality-specific representations are fused using an attention-based mechanism followed by a gating unit to enhance robustness and prediction accuracy. Experimental results on data from 7,731 real-world NEEQ companies demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms traditional machine learning methods and single-modality baselines in terms of AUC, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score.

While existing large vision-language models (LVLMs) for scene understanding have primarily focused on indoor household tasks, they face two significant limitations when applied to outdoor large-scale scene understanding. First, outdoor scenarios typically encompass larger-scale environments observed through various sensors from multiple viewpoints (e.g., bird view and terrestrial view), while existing indoor LVLMs mainly analyze single visual modalities within building-scale contexts from humanoid viewpoints. Second, existing LVLMs suffer from missing multidomain perception outdoor data and struggle to effectively integrate 2D and 3D visual information. To address the aforementioned limitations, we build the first multidomain perception outdoor scene understanding dataset, named \\textbf{\\underline{SVM-City}}, deriving from multi\\textbf{\\underline{S}}cale scenarios with multi\\textbf{\\underline{V}}iew and multi\\textbf{\\underline{M}}odal instruction tuning data. It contains $420$k images and $4, 811$M point clouds with $567$k question-answering pairs from vehicles, low-altitude drones, high-altitude aerial planes, and satellite. To effectively fuse the multimodal data in the absence of one modality, we introduce incomplete multimodal learning to model outdoor scene understanding and design the LVLM named \\textbf{\\underline{City-VLM}}. Multimodal fusion is realized by constructing a joint probabilistic distribution space rather than implementing directly explicit fusion operations (e.g., concatenation).

While Transformer-based architectures have shown promise, their quadratic complexity with sequence length hinders their efficiency for long-term predictions. Recent advancements in State-Space Models, such as Mamba, offer a more efficient alternative for long-term modeling, but they cannot capture multi-scale periodicity and transient dynamics effectively.

Fortunately, foundation models, pre-trained on vast open-world datasets, demonstrate strong potential for this task due to their generalizable representation, which promotes the development of adaptive strategies on pre-trained models in long-tailed learning. Advanced fine-tuning methods typically adjust visual encoders while neglecting the semantics derived from the frozen text encoder, overlooking the visual and textual alignment. To strengthen this alignment, we propose a novel approach, Semantic-guided fine-tuning of foundation model for long-tailed visual recognition (Sage), which incorporates semantic guidance derived from textual modality into the visual fine-tuning process. Specifically, we introduce an SG-Adapter that integrates class descriptions as semantic guidance to guide the fine-tuning of the visual encoder. The introduced guidance is passesed through the attention mechanism and enables the model to focus more on semantically relevant content, strengthening the alignment between the visual and textual modalities. Due to the inconsistent class-conditional distributions neglected by the existing loss function, the resulting prediction bias causes performance improvements for the tail class less than for the head class, even when the multi-modal alignment is enhanced. To address this challenge, we propose a novel distribution mismatch-aware compensation factor, which is specifically designed to rectify the prediction bias caused by the ignored inconsistent distribution based on our theoretical analysis, and is seamlessly integrated into the loss function. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Sage in enhancing performance in long-tailed learning."

Reduced-order modeling (ROM) addresses these challenges by constructing a low-dimensional surrogate model but relies on a fixed discretization, which limits flexibility across varying meshes during evaluation. Operator learning approaches, such as neural operators, offer an alternative by parameterizing mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces, enabling adaptation to data across different resolutions. Whereas ROM provides rigorous numerical error estimates, neural operator learning largely focuses on discretization convergence and invariance without quantifying the error between the infinite-dimensional and the discretized operators. This work introduces the reduced-order neural operator modeling (RONOM) framework, which bridges concepts from ROM and operator learning. We establish a discretization error bound analogous to those in ROM, and get insights into RONOM's discretization convergence and discretization robustness. Moreover, two numerical examples are presented that compare RONOM to existing neural operators for solving partial differential equations. The results demonstrate that RONOM using standard vector-to-vector neural networks achieves comparable performance in input generalization and superior performance in both spatial super-resolution and discretization robustness, while also offering novel insights into temporal super-resolution scenarios."

To address this, we propose ReLOAD (Reinforcement Learning with Offline Reward Annotation via Distillation), a novel reward annotation framework for offline RL. Unlike existing methods that depend on complex alignment procedures, our approach adapts Random Network Distillation (RND) to generate intrinsic rewards from expert demonstrations using a simple yet effective embedding discrepancy measure. First, we train a predictor network to mimic a fixed target network's embeddings based on expert state transitions. Later, the prediction error between these networks serves as a reward signal for each transition in the static dataset. This mechanism provides a structured reward signal without requiring handcrafted reward annotations. We provide a formal theoretical construct that offers insights into how RND prediction errors effectively serve as intrinsic rewards by distinguishing expert-like transitions. Experiments on the D4RL benchmark demonstrate that ReLOAD enables robust offline policy learning and achieves performance competitive with traditional reward-annotated methods."

However, these annotations are typically event-centric, which is not enough to capture the broader context of each video. The absence of essential details such as object types, spatial layouts, and descriptive attributes restricts the model to learning only a fragmented scene representation.

Among various CIR approaches, training-free zero-shot methods based on pre-trained models are cost-effective but still face notable limitations. For example, sequential VLM-LLM pipelines process each modality independently, which often results in information loss and limits cross-modal interaction. In contrast, methods based on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often focus exclusively on applying changes indicated by the text, without fully utilizing the contextual visual information from the reference image. To address these issues, we propose multi-faceted Chain-of-Thought with re-ranking (MCoT-RE), a training-free zero-shot CIR framework. MCoT-RE utilizes multi-faceted Chain-of-Thought to guide the MLLM to balance explicit modifications and contextual visual cues, generating two distinct captions: one focused on modification and the other integrating comprehensive visual-textual context. The first caption is used to filter candidate images. Subsequently, we combine these two captions and the reference image to perform multi-grained re-ranking. This two-stage approach facilitates precise retrieval by aligning with the textual modification instructions while preserving the visual context of the reference image. Through extensive experiments, MCoT-RE achieves state-of-the-art results among training-free methods, yielding improvements of up to 6.24% in Recall@10 on FashionIQ and 8.58% in Recall@1 on CIRR."

While effectively fusing visual and textual modalities is crucial, existing methods typically adopt either early or late fusion. Early fusion tends to excessively focus on explicitly mentioned textual details and neglect visual context, whereas late fusion struggles to capture fine-grained semantic alignments between image regions and textual tokens. To address these issues, we propose FAR-Net, a multi-stage fusion framework designed with enhanced semantic alignment and adaptive reconciliation, integrating two complementary modules. The enhanced semantic alignment module (ESAM) employs late fusion with cross-attention to capture fine-grained semantic relationships, while the adaptive reconciliation module (ARM) applies early fusion with uncertainty embeddings to enhance robustness and adaptability. Experiments on CIRR and FashionIQ show consistent performance gains, improving Recall@1 by up to 2.4% and Recall@50 by 1.04% over existing state-of-the-art methods, empirically demonstrating that FAR Net provides a robust and scalable solution to CIR tasks."

With the development of technology, the need for accurate classification of food images has grown, which is crucial for a variety of application scenarios. However, existing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) face significant challenges when dealing with fine-grained food images that are similar in shape but subtle in detail. To address this challenge, this study presents an innovative method for classifying food images, named Feature-Enhanced TResNet (FE-TResNet), specifically designed to address fine-grained food images and accurately capture subtle features within them. The FE-TResNet method is based on the TResNet model and integrates Style-based Recalibration Module (StyleRM) and Deep Channel-wise Attention (DCA) technologies to enhance feature extraction capabilities. In experimental validation on Chinese food image datasets ChineseFoodNet and CNFOOD-241, the FE-TResNet method significantly improved classification accuracy, achieving rates of 81.37% and 80.29%, respectively, demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority in fine-grained food image classification."

NTKs typically actively change during training and are related to feature learning. In parallel, recent work on Gradient Descent (GD) has found a phenomenon called Edge of Stability (EoS), in which the largest eigenvalue of the NTK oscillates around a value inversely proportional to the step size. However, although follow-up works have explored the underlying mechanism of such eigenvalue behavior in depth, the understanding of the behavior of the NTK eigenvectors during EoS is still missing. This paper examines the dynamics of NTK eigenvectors during EoS in detail. Across different architectures, we observe that larger learning rates cause the leading eigenvectors of the final NTK, as well as the full NTK matrix, to have greater alignment with the training target. We then study the underlying mechanism of this phenomenon and provide a theoretical analysis for a two-layer linear network. Our study enhances the understanding of GD training dynamics in deep learning."

We examine code-mixed coreferential statements conveyed identical knowledge across languages to study cross-lingual knowledge consistency. We use some interpretability approaches to analyze the behavior of a model in cross-lingual contexts, discovering that multilingual models show different levels of consistency, subject to language families, linguistic factors, and a bottleneck in cross-lingual consistency on a particular layer. In addition, we evaluate common strategies aimed at improving multilingual performance to observe whether these strategies can improve knowledge consistency at the same time. While knowledge is not cross-lingual consistency in many cases, code-switching training and cross-lingual word alignment objectives show the most promising results, emphasizing the noteworthiness of cross-lingual alignment supervision and code-switching training for both multilingual performance and cross-lingual consistency enhancement."

Existing DCT methods mainly measure discrepancies between a distribution pair defined on discrete one-dimensional spaces (e.g., using total variation), which limits their applications to complex data (e.g., images). To extend DCT to more types of data, a natural idea is to introduce maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), a powerful measurement of the distributional discrepancy between two complex distributions, into DCT scenarios. However, we find that MMD's value can be the same for many pairs of distributions that have different norms in the same reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), making MMD less informative when assessing the closeness levels for multiple distribution pairs. To mitigate the issue, we design a new measurement of distributional discrepancy, norm-adaptive MMD (NAMMD), which scales MMD's value using the RKHS norms of distributions. Based on the asymptotic distribution of NAMMD, we finally propose the NAMMD-based DCT to assess the closeness levels of a distribution pair. Theoretically, we prove that NAMMD-based DCT has higher test power compared to MMD-based DCT, with bounded type-I error, which is also validated by extensive experiments on many types of data (e.g., synthetic noise, real images). Furthermore, we also apply the proposed NAMMD for addressing the two-sample testing problem and find NAMMD-based two-sample test has higher test power than the MMD-based two-sample test in both theory and experiments."

Owing to CLIP's strong ability to encode semantic concepts, it has attracted increasing interest in domain generalization. However, CLIP often struggles to focus on task-relevant regions across domains, i.e., domain-invariant regions, resulting in suboptimal performance on unseen target domains. To address this challenge, we propose an attention-refocusing scheme, called Simulate, Refocus and Ensemble (SRE), which learns to reduce the domain shift by aligning the attention maps in CLIP via attention refocusing. SRE first simulates domain shifts by performing augmentation on the source data to generate simulated target domains. SRE then learns to reduce the domain shifts by refocusing the attention in CLIP between the source and simulated target domains. Finally, SRE utilizes ensemble learning to enhance the ability to capture domain-invariant attention maps between the source data and the simulated target data. Extensive experimental results on several datasets demonstrate that SRE generally achieves better results than state-of-the-art methods.

Most prior wireless-based approaches rely on movement patterns, such as walking gait, to extract biometric cues. In contrast, we propose a transformer-based method that identifies individuals from Channel State Information (CSI) recorded while the subject remains stationary. CSI captures fine-grained amplitude and phase distortions induced by the unique interaction between the human body and the radio signal. To support evaluation, we introduce a dataset acquired with ESP32 devices in a controlled indoor environment, featuring six participants observed across multiple orientations. A tailored preprocessing pipeline, including outlier removal, smoothing, and phase calibration, enhances signal quality. Our dual-branch transformer architecture processes amplitude and phase modalities separately and achieves 99.82\\% classification accuracy, outperforming convolutional and multilayer perceptron baselines. These results demonstrate the discriminative potential of CSI perturbations, highlighting their capacity to encode biometric traits in a consistent manner.

Here, we draw on a connection between this successful strategy and the theory and practice of finding optimal policies via Reinforcement Learning (RL). Building on existing literature, we clarify that SFT can be understood as maximizing a lower bound on the RL objective in a sparse reward setting. Giving support to its often observed good performance. From this viewpoint, we realize that a small modification to SFT leads to an importance weighted variant that behaves closer to training with RL as it: i) optimizes a tighter bound to the RL objective and, ii) can improve performance compared to SFT on curated data. We refer to this variant as importance weighted supervised fine-tuning (iw-SFT). We show that it is easy to implement and can be further generalized to training with quality scored data. The resulting SFT variants are competitive with more advanced RL algorithms for large language models and for training policies in continuous control tasks.

Most existing methods commonly adhere to a conventional training-test paradigm, where models are pretrained on training data and then directly applied to test samples. However, the success of this paradigm hinges on the assumption that the data are independently and identically distributed, which often fails in practical social networks due to the inherent uncertainty and variability of user behavior. In the paper, we address the novel challenge of distribution shifts within IDP tasks and propose a robust test-time training (TTT)-based framework for multi-scale diffusion prediction, named T3MAL. The core idea is to flexibly adapt a trained model to accommodate the distribution of each test instance before making predictions via a self-supervised auxiliary task. Specifically, T3MAL introduces a BYOL-inspired self-supervised auxiliary network that shares a common feature extraction backbone with the primary diffusion prediction network to guide instance-specific adaptation during testing. Furthermore, T3MAL enables fast and accurate test-time adaptation by incorporating a novel meta-auxiliary learning scheme and a lightweight adaptor, which together provide better weight initialization for TTT and mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that T3MAL outperforms various state-of-the-art methods."

NeckSense captures dynamic changes in tissue impedance around the neck, which are modulated by head rotations and subtle muscle activations. To robustly estimate head pose, we propose a deep learning framework that integrates anatomical priors, including joint constraints and natural head rotation ranges, into the loss function design. We validate NeckSense on 7 participants using the current SOTA pose estimation model as ground truth. Our system achieves a mean per-vertex error of 25.9 mm across various head movements with a leave-one-person-out cross-validation method, demonstrating that a compact, line-of-sight-free bio-impedance wearable can deliver head-tracking performance comparable to SOTA vision-based methods."

Physiological signal-based approaches offer more direct access to internal states but require complex sensors that compromise natural behavior and limit scalability.Gaze-based methods typically rely on static fixation analysis and fail to capture the rich,dynamic interactions between gaze and the environment,and thus cannot uncover the deep connection between emotion and implicit behavior.To address these limitations,we propose a novel camera-based,user-unaware emotion recognition approach that integrates gaze fixation patterns with environmental semantics and temporal dynamics.Leveraging standard HD cameras,our method unobtrusively captures users'eye appearance and head movements in natural settings-without the need for specialized hardware or active user participation.From these visual cues,the system estimates gaze trajectories over time and space, providing the basis for modeling the spatial, semantic,and temporal dimensions of gaze behavior. This allows us to capture the dynamic interplay between visual attention and the surrounding environment,revealing that emotions are not merely physiological responses but complex outcomes of human-environment interactions.The proposed approach enables user-unaware,real-time,and continuous emotion recognition,offering high generalizability and low deployment cost."

However, domain shifts often undermine model reliability when deployed in new environments. Ensuring the robustness and safety of lane detection models typically requires collecting and annotating target domain data, which is resource-intensive. Estimating model performance without ground-truth labels offers a promising alternative for efficient robustness assessment, yet remains underexplored in lane detection. While previous work has addressed performance estimation in image classification, these methods are not directly applicable to lane detection tasks. This paper first adapts five well-performing performance estimation methods from image classification to lane detection, building a baseline. Addressing the limitations of prior approaches that solely rely on softmax scores or lane features, we further propose a new Lane Performance Estimation Framework (LanePerf), which integrates image and lane features using a pretrained image encoder and a DeepSets-based architecture, effectively handling zero-lane detection scenarios and large domain-shift cases. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane dataset, covering diverse domain shifts (scenes, weather, hours), demonstrate that our LanePerf outperforms all baselines, achieving a lower MAE of 0.117 and a higher Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of 0.727. These findings pave the way for robust, label-free performance estimation in ADAS, supporting more efficient testing and improved safety in challenging driving scenarios."

In this paper, we introduce VIdeo Diffusion for Action Reasoning (VIDAR), a two-stage framework that leverages large-scale, diffusion-based video pre-training and a novel masked inverse dynamics model for action prediction. We pre-train the video diffusion model on 750K multi-view videos from three real-world bimanual robot platforms, utilizing a unified observation space that encodes robot, camera, task, and scene contexts. Our masked inverse dynamics model learns masks to extract action-relevant information from generated trajectories without requiring pixel-level labels, and the masks can effectively generalize to unseen backgrounds. Our experiments demonstrate that with only 20 minutes of human demonstrations on an unseen robot platform (only 1% of typical data requirements), VIDAR generalizes to unseen tasks and backgrounds with strong semantic understanding, surpassing state-of-the-art methods. Our findings highlight the potential of video foundation models, coupled with masked action prediction, to enable scalable and generalizable robotic manipulation in diverse real-world settings."

We argue that classifiers should have the option to refuse handling inputs whose predictions cannot be explained properly and introduce a framework for learning to reject low-quality explanations (LtX) in which predictors are equipped with a rejector that evaluates the quality of explanations. In this problem setting, the key challenges are how to properly define and assess explanation quality and how to design a suitable rejector. Focusing on popular attribution techniques, we introduce ULER (User-centric Low-quality Explanation Rejector), which learns a simple rejector from human ratings and per-feature relevance judgments to mirror human judgments of explanation quality. Our experiments show that ULER outperforms both state-of-the-art and explanation-aware learning to reject strategies at LtX on eight classification and regression benchmarks and on a new human-annotated dataset, which we will publicly release to support future research."

This paper introduces a new dataset containing 23,326 images collected from eight different commercial sources and classified into 31 categories, similar to the Office-31 dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first image classification dataset specifically designed for Federated Learning. We also propose two new Federated Learning algorithms, namely Fed-Cyclic and Fed-Star. In Fed-Cyclic, a client receives weights from its previous client, updates them through local training, and passes them to the next client, thus forming a cyclic topology. In Fed-Star, a client receives weights from all other clients, updates its local weights through pre-aggregation (to address statistical heterogeneity) and local training, and sends its updated local weights to all other clients, thus forming a star-like topology. Our experiments reveal that both algorithms perform better than existing baselines on our newly introduced dataset."

However, its practical application is hindered by two factors: a lack of realistic sports datasets and unclear reliability for sports tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce the AthleticsPose dataset, a new public dataset featuring ``real'' motions captured from 23 athletes performing various athletics events on an athletic field. Using this dataset, we trained a representative 3D pose estimation model and performed a comprehensive evaluation. Our results show that the model trained on AthleticsPose significantly outperforms a baseline model trained on an imitated sports motion dataset, reducing MPJPE by approximately 75 %. These results show the importance of training on authentic sports motion data, as models based on imitated motions do not effectively transfer to real-world motions. Further analysis reveals that estimation accuracy is sensitive to camera view and subject scale. In case studies of kinematic indicators, the model demonstrated the potential to capture individual differences in knee angles but struggled with higher-speed metrics, such as knee-drive velocity, due to prediction biases. This work provides the research community with a valuable dataset and clarifies the potential and practical limitations of using monocular 3D pose estimation for sports motion analysis.

Although Transformer-based forecasting models have demonstrated remarkable success in general tasks, their computational efficiency often falls short of the stringent requirements in large-scale cloud environments. Given that most workload series exhibit complicated periodic patterns, addressing these challenges in the frequency domain offers substantial advantages. To this end, we propose Fremer, an efficient and effective deep forecasting model. Fremer fulfills three critical requirements: it demonstrates superior efficiency, outperforming most Transformer-based forecasting models; it achieves exceptional accuracy, surpassing all state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in workload forecasting; and it exhibits robust performance for multi-period series. Furthermore, we collect and open-source four high-quality, open-source workload datasets derived from ByteDance's cloud services, encompassing workload data from thousands of computing instances. Extensive experiments on both our proprietary datasets and public benchmarks demonstrate that Fremer consistently outperforms baseline models, achieving average improvements of 5.5% in MSE, 4.7% in MAE, and 8.6% in SMAPE over SOTA models, while simultaneously reducing parameter scale and computational costs. Additionally, in a proactive auto-scaling test based on Kubernetes, Fremer improves average latency by 18.78% and reduces resource consumption by 2.35%, underscoring its practical efficacy in real-world applications."

Specifically, we distinguish between aleatoric (data-related) and epistemic (model-related) uncertainty to guide the selection of appropriate explanations. Epistemic uncertainty serves as a rejection criterion for unreliable explanations and, in itself, provides insight into insufficient training (a new form of explanation). Aleatoric uncertainty informs the choice between feature-importance explanations and counterfactual explanations. This leverages a framework of explainability methods driven by uncertainty quantification and disentanglement. Our experiments demonstrate the impact of this uncertainty-aware approach on the robustness and attainability of explanations in both traditional machine learning and deep learning scenarios."

Especially, the new era has witnessed a remarkable capability to extend Large Language Models (LLMs) for tackling tasks of 3D scene understanding. Current methods rely heavily on 3D point clouds, but the 3D point cloud reconstruction of an indoor scene often results in information loss. Some textureless planes or repetitive patterns are prone to omission and manifest as voids within the reconstructed 3D point clouds. Besides, objects with complex structures tend to introduce distortion of details caused by misalignments between the captured images and the dense reconstructed point clouds. 2D multi-view images present visual consistency with 3D point clouds and provide more detailed representations of scene components, which can naturally compensate for these deficiencies. Based on these insights, we propose Argus, a novel 3D multimodal framework that leverages multi-view images for enhanced 3D scene understanding with LLMs. In general, Argus can be treated as a 3D Large Multimodal Foundation Model (3D-LMM) since it takes various modalities as input(text instructions, 2D multi-view images, and 3D point clouds) and expands the capability of LLMs to tackle 3D tasks. Argus involves fusing and integrating multi-view images and camera poses into view-as-scene features, which interact with the 3D features to create comprehensive and detailed 3D-aware scene embeddings. Our approach compensates for the information loss while reconstructing 3D point clouds and helps LLMs better understand the 3D world. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing 3D-LMMs in various downstream tasks."

This approach improves training stability and convergence speed by adaptively adjusting the learning step size. Secondly, we extend this idea to re-utilize zero-reward samples, which are often discarded by dynamic sampling strategies like DAPO's. By treating these samples as a distinct batch guided by the expert policy, we further enhance sample efficiency. We provide a theoretical analysis for both methods, demonstrating that their objective functions converge to the optimal solution within the established theoretical framework of reinforcement learning.

Recent post-training quantization (PTQ) methods have attempted to mitigate this issue by focusing on the iterative nature of diffusion models. However, these approaches often overlook outliers, leading to degraded performance at low bit-widths. In this paper, we propose a DMQ which combines Learned Equivalent Scaling (LES) and channel-wise Power-of-Two Scaling (PTS) to effectively address these challenges. Learned Equivalent Scaling optimizes channel-wise scaling factors to redistribute quantization difficulty between weights and activations, reducing overall quantization error. Recognizing that early denoising steps, despite having small quantization errors, crucially impact the final output due to error accumulation, we incorporate an adaptive timestep weighting scheme to prioritize these critical steps during learning. Furthermore, identifying that layers such as skip connections exhibit high inter-channel variance, we introduce channel-wise Power-of-Two Scaling for activations. To ensure robust selection of PTS factors even with small calibration set, we introduce a voting algorithm that enhances reliability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing works, especially at low bit-widths such as W4A6 (4-bit weight, 6-bit activation) and W4A8, maintaining high image generation quality and model stability.

However, interrelationship among input modalities, uncertainties due to individual uni-modal data and potential clinical applications following such an uncertainty decomposition are yet fully understood in the context of large-scale MLLMs. In this work, we propose a multimodal uncertainty propagation model (MUPM) based on uncertainty propagation, to characterise the relationship among the uncertainties arising from image-only, text-only, and joint image-text variations in MLLM inputs. Using real clinical data consisting of cardiac MR scans and digital health records, we describe that MUPMs can be optimised robustly with a few samples. We then show that the fitted MUPMs are generalisable across different input data distributions and, perhaps surprisingly, across different downstream tasks. Such a transferability may be explained by the shared pretraining, comparatively light MLLM fine-tuning, along with the low-dimensional nature of the MUPMs. More importantly, this learned transferability, quantifying the relationship between these uncertainties, led to direct clinical applications in which uncertainties may be estimated and thus analysed robustly for varying data or even a novel set of cardiac disease prediction tasks. In addition, we show experimentally the efficiency in multimodal data required for estimating the overall uncertainty and its ability to identify redundant factors, both of which are considered practical yet clinically useful applications with the proposed MUPMs. Codes are available at https://github.com/yucheng722/MUPM."

Current LLM-based error detection methods often fail to detect propagated errors because they do not properly account for how earlier errors might corrupt judgments of downstream reasoning. To better detect such propagated errors, we introduce Autoregressive Reasoning Entailment Stability (ARES), a novel probabilistic framework that prevents error propagation by judging each claim based only on previously-assessed sound premises. This inductive method yields a nuanced score for each step and provides certified statistical guarantees of its soundness, rather than a brittle binary label. ARES achieves state-of-the-art performance across four benchmarks (72.1% Macro-F1, +8.2 points) and demonstrates superior robustness on very long synthetic reasoning chains, where it excels at detecting propagated errors (90.3% F1, +27.6 points)."

Mechanistic interpretability, particularly through the use of sparse autoencoders (SAEs), offers a promising approach for uncovering human-interpretable features within large transformer-based models. In this study, we apply Matryoshka-SAE to the radiology-specialised multimodal large language model, MAIRA-2, to interpret its internal representations. Using large-scale automated interpretability of the SAE features, we identify a range of clinically relevant concepts - including medical devices (e.g., line and tube placements, pacemaker presence), pathologies such as pleural effusion and cardiomegaly, longitudinal changes and textual features. We further examine the influence of these features on model behaviour through steering, demonstrating directional control over generations with mixed success. Our results reveal practical and methodological challenges, yet they offer initial insights into the internal concepts learned by MAIRA-2 - marking a step toward deeper mechanistic understanding and interpretability of a radiology-adapted multimodal large language model, and paving the way for improved model transparency.

Furthermore, existing approaches lack support for multi-character animation, as driving features from different individuals frequently interfere with one another, complicating the task. To address these challenges, we propose FantasyPortrait, a diffusion transformer based framework capable of generating high-fidelity and emotion-rich animations for both single- and multi-character scenarios. Our method introduces an expression-augmented learning strategy that utilizes implicit representations to capture identity-agnostic facial dynamics, enhancing the model's ability to render fine-grained emotions. For multi-character control, we design a masked cross-attention mechanism that ensures independent yet coordinated expression generation, effectively preventing feature interference. To advance research in this area, we propose the Multi-Expr dataset and ExprBench, which are specifically designed datasets and benchmarks for training and evaluating multi-character portrait animations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FantasyPortrait significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations, excelling particularly in challenging cross reenactment and multi-character contexts.

However, a common issue that arises when repeatedly applying layer operators on graphs is over-smoothing, which consists in the convergence of graph signals toward low-frequency components of the graph Laplacian. This work revisits the definition of the reservoir in the Multiresolution Reservoir Graph Neural Network (MRGNN), a spectral reservoir model, and proposes a variant based on a Fairing algorithm originally introduced in the field of surface design in computer graphics. This algorithm provides a pass-band spectral filter that allows smoothing without shrinkage, and it can be adapted to the graph setting through the Laplacian operator. Given its spectral formulation, this method naturally connects to GNN architectures for tasks where smoothing, when properly controlled, can be beneficial,such as graph classification. The core contribution of the paper lies in the theoretical analysis of the algorithm from a random walks perspective. In particular, it shows how tuning the spectral coefficients can be interpreted as modulating the contribution of redundant random walks. Exploratory experiments based on the MRGNN architecture illustrate the potential of this approach and suggest promising directions for future research."

Computer vision presents a promising avenue, contingent upon the availability of extensive datasets, a notable challenge in medical imaging. Therefore, reliance solely on one modality, such as images, proves inadequate, especially in an era of diverse and plentiful data types. In this study, we employ a multifaceted approach to address the challenge of recognizing wrist pathologies using an extremely limited dataset. Initially, we approach the problem as a fine-grained recognition task, aiming to identify subtle X-ray pathologies that conventional CNNs overlook. Secondly, we enhance network performance by fusing patient metadata with X-ray images. Thirdly, rather than pre-training on a coarse-grained dataset like ImageNet, we utilize weights trained on a fine-grained dataset. While metadata integration has been used in other medical domains, this is a novel application for wrist pathologies. Our results show that a fine-grained strategy and metadata integration improve diagnostic accuracy by 2% with a limited dataset and by over 10% with a larger fracture-focused dataset."

A key difficulty in SR is estimating the unobservable feature, which encapsulates significant spectral information not captured by RGB imaging sensors. The solution lies in effectively constructing the spectral-spatial joint distribution conditioned on the RGB image to complement the unobservable feature. Since HSIs share a similar spatial structure with the corresponding RGB images, it is rational to capitalize on the rich spatial knowledge in RGB pre-trained models for spectral-spatial joint distribution learning. To this end, we extend the RGB pre-trained latent diffusion model (RGB-LDM) to an unobservable feature LDM (ULDM) for SR. As the RGB-LDM and its corresponding spatial autoencoder (SpaAE) already excel in spatial knowledge, the ULDM can focus on modeling spectral structure. Moreover, separating the unobservable feature from the HSI reduces the redundant spectral information and empowers the ULDM to learn the joint distribution in a compact latent space. Specifically, we propose a two-stage pipeline consisting of spectral structure representation learning and spectral-spatial joint distribution learning to transform the RGB-LDM into the ULDM. In the first stage, a spectral unobservable feature autoencoder (SpeUAE) is trained to extract and compress the unobservable feature into a 3D manifold aligned with RGB space. In the second stage, the spectral and spatial structures are sequentially encoded by the SpeUAE and the SpaAE, respectively. The ULDM is then acquired to model the distribution of the coded unobservable feature with guidance from the corresponding RGB images. Experimental results on SR and downstream relighting tasks demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance."

Recognizing the importance of spectral and temporal information, we introduce the WaveletInception-BiLSTM network. The WaveletInception feature extractor utilizes a Learnable Wavelet Packet Transform (LWPT) as the stem for extracting vibration signal features, incorporating spectral information in the early network layers. This is followed by 1D Inception networks that extract multi-scale, high-level features at deeper layers. The extracted vibration signal features are then integrated with operational conditions via a Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) layer. The resulting feature extraction network effectively analyzes drive-by vibration signals across various measurement speeds without preprocessing and uses LSTM to capture interrelated temporal dependencies among different modes of information and to create feature vectors for health condition estimation. The estimator head is designed with a sequential modeling architecture using bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) networks, capturing bi-directional temporal relationships from drive-by measurements. This architecture allows for a high-resolution, beam-level assessment of infrastructure health conditions. A case study focusing on railway track stiffness estimation with simulated drive-by vibration signals shows that the model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in estimating railway ballast and railpad stiffness parameters. Results underscore the potential of this approach for accurate, localized, and fully automated drive-by infrastructure health monitoring."

At the same time, Generative AI -- particularly Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) -- have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of domains, such as healthcare, security, and Image Generation. However, training generative models typically requires large datasets and significant computational resources, which are often unavailable in real-world settings. Acquiring such resources can be costly and inefficient, especially when many underutilized devices -- such as IoT devices and edge devices -- with varying capabilities remain idle. Moreover, obtaining large datasets is challenging due to privacy concerns and copyright restrictions, as most devices are unwilling to share their data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach for decentralized GAN training that enables the utilization of distributed data and underutilized, low-capability devices while not sharing data in its raw form. Our approach is designed to tackle key challenges in decentralized environments, combining KLD-weighted Clustered Federated Learning to address the issues of data heterogeneity and multi-domain datasets, with Heterogeneous U-Shaped split learning to tackle the challenge of device heterogeneity under strict data sharing constraints -- ensuring that no labels or raw data, whether real or synthetic, are ever shared between nodes. Experimental results shows that our approach demonstrates consistent and significant improvements across key performance metrics, where it achieves 1.1x -- 2.2x higher image generation scores, an average 10% boost in classification metrics (up to 50% in multi-domain non-IID settings), in much lower latency compared to several benchmarks.

While structured pruning methods can reduce these factors, they often require costly retraining, sometimes for up to hundreds of epochs, or even training from scratch to recover the lost accuracy resulting from the structural modifications. Maintaining the provided performance of trained models after structured pruning and thereby avoiding extensive retraining remains a challenge. To solve this, we introduce Variance-Based Pruning, a simple and structured one-shot pruning technique for efficiently compressing networks, with minimal finetuning. Our approach first gathers activation statistics, which are used to select neurons for pruning. Simultaneously the mean activations are integrated back into the model to preserve a high degree of performance. On ImageNet-1k recognition tasks, we demonstrate that directly after pruning DeiT-Base retains over 70% of its original performance and requires only 10 epochs of fine-tuning to regain 99% of the original accuracy while simultaneously reducing MACs by 35% and model size by 36%, thus speeding up the model by 1.44x."

Sample selection as an alternative efficient paradigm plays an important direction to accelerate the training process. However, recent advances on sample selection either mostly rely on an oracle model to offline select a high-quality coreset, which is limited in the cold-start scenarios, or focus on online selection based on real-time model predictions, which has not sufficiently or efficiently considered the noisy correspondence. To address this dilemma, we propose a novel Differential-Informed Sample Selection (DISSect) method, which accurately and efficiently discriminates the noisy correspondence for training acceleration. Specifically, we rethink the impact of noisy correspondence on contrastive learning and propose that the differential between the predicted correlation of the current model and that of a historical model is more informative to characterize sample quality. Based on this, we construct a robust differential-based sample selection and analyze its theoretical insights. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and various downstream tasks demonstrate the consistent superiority of DISSect over current state-of-the-art methods.

Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models often represent relations in a KG as geometric transformations. Most state-of-the-art (SOTA) KGE models are derived from elementary geometric transformations (EGTs), such as translation, scaling, rotation, and reflection, or their combinations. These geometric transformations enable the models to effectively preserve specific structural and relational patterns of the KG. However, the current use of EGTs by KGEs remains insufficient without considering relation-specific transformations. Although recent models attempted to address this problem by ensembling SOTA baseline models in different ways, only a single or composite version of geometric transformations are used by such baselines to represent all the relations. In this paper, we propose a framework that evaluates how well each relation fits with different geometric transformations. Based on this ranking, the model can: (1) assign the best-matching transformation to each relation, or (2) use majority voting to choose one transformation type to apply across all relations. That is, the model learns a single relation-specific EGT in low dimensional vector space through an attention mechanism. Furthermore, we use the correlation between relations and EGTs, which are learned in a low dimension, for relation embeddings in a high dimensional vector space. The effectiveness of our models is demonstrated through comprehensive evaluations on three benchmark KGs as well as a real-world financial KG, witnessing a performance comparable to leading models"

        "summary": "arXiv:2507.13018v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Deep learning-based image manipulation localization (IML) methods have achieved remarkable performance in recent years, but typically rely on large-scale pixel-level annotated datasets. To address the challenge of acquiring high-quality annotations, some recent weakly supervised methods utilize image-level labels to segment manipulated regions. However, the performance is still limited due to insufficient supervision signals. In this study, we explore a form of weak supervision that improves the annotation efficiency and detection performance, namely scribble annotation supervision. We re-annotated mainstream IML datasets with scribble labels and propose the first scribble-based IML (Sc-IML) dataset. Additionally, we propose the first scribble-based weakly supervised IML framework. Specifically, we employ self-supervised training with a structural consistency loss to encourage the model to produce consistent predictions under multi-scale and augmented inputs. In addition, we propose a prior-aware feature modulation module (PFMM) that adaptively integrates prior information from both manipulated and authentic regions for dynamic feature adjustment, further enhancing feature discriminability and prediction consistency in complex scenes. We also propose a gated adaptive fusion module (GAFM) that utilizes gating mechanisms to regulate information flow during feature fusion, guiding the model toward emphasizing potential tampered regions. Finally, we propose a confidence-aware entropy minimization loss (${\\mathcal{L}}_{ {CEM }}$). This loss dynamically regularizes predictions in weakly annotated or unlabeled regions based on model uncertainty, effectively suppressing unreliable predictions. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing fully supervised approaches in terms of average performance both in-distribution and out-of-distribution."

Unlike existing approaches in the literature, our solution is designed to meet a broader range of key requirements. This includes estimating confidence levels for predictions, detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) cases, and controlling false alarms. The proposed solution is based on a temporal convolutional autoencoder to automatically extract low-dimensional features from raw sensor data. Fault detection and diagnosis are respectively carried out using a binary and a multiclass classifier trained on the autoencoder latent and residual spaces. The classifiers are histogram-based gradient boosting models calibrated to output probabilities that can be interpreted as confidence levels. A relatively simple technique, based on inductive conformal anomaly detection, is used to identify OOD data. We leverage other simple yet effective techniques, such as cumulative sum control chart (CUSUM) to limit the false alarms, and threshold moving to address class imbalance in fault detection. The proposed framework is highly configurable and has been evaluated on simulated data, covering both nominal and anomalous operational scenarios. The results indicate that our solution is a promising first step, though testing with real data will be necessary to ensure that it achieves the required maturity level for operational use."

Monitoring these regions at scale using satellite imagery and machine learning is promising, but current methods often lack interpretability and uncertainty-awareness, and do not address how uncertainty affects naturalness assessment. In contrast, we propose Confidence-Filtered Relevance (CFR), a data-centric framework that combines LRP Attention Rollout with Deep Deterministic Uncertainty (DDU) estimation to analyze how model uncertainty influences the interpretability of relevance heatmaps. CFR partitions the dataset into subsets based on uncertainty thresholds, enabling systematic analysis of how uncertainty shapes the explanations of naturalness in satellite imagery. Applied to the AnthroProtect dataset, CFR assigned higher relevance to shrublands, forests, and wetlands, aligning with other research on naturalness assessment. Moreover, our analysis shows that as uncertainty increases, the interpretability of these relevance heatmaps declines and their entropy grows, indicating less selective and more ambiguous attributions. CFR provides a data-centric approach to assess the relevance of patterns to naturalness in satellite imagery based on their associated certainty."

However, existing models are often tightly coupled with various time-series-specific designs, making it difficult to isolate the impact of the architecture itself. To address this, we propose a novel taxonomy that disentangles these designs, enabling clearer and more unified comparisons of Transformer architectures. Our taxonomy considers key aspects such as attention mechanisms, forecasting aggregations, forecasting paradigms, and normalization layers. Through extensive experiments, we uncover several key insights: bi-directional attention with joint-attention is most effective; more complete forecasting aggregation improves performance; and the direct-mapping paradigm outperforms autoregressive approaches. Furthermore, our combined model, utilizing optimal architectural choices, consistently outperforms several existing models, reinforcing the validity of our conclusions.

Our main result shows that PAC learnability of all such finite-support copies implies online learnability of the full isomorphism type of G, and is equivalent to the condition of automorphic triviality. We also characterize graphs where copies induced by swapping two vertices are not learnable, using a relaxation of the extension property of the infinite random graph.

To address the challenges, this paper proposes a Hierarchical Coresets Selection (HCS) mechanism to advance the adaptation of VLMs in complex wide-area scene understanding. It progressively refines the selected regions based on the proposed theoretically guaranteed importance function, which considers utility, representativeness, robustness, and synergy. Without requiring additional fine-tuning, HCS enables VLMs to achieve rapid understandings of unseen scenes at any scale using minimal interpretable regions while mitigating insufficient feature density. HCS is a plug-and-play method that is compatible with any VLM. Experiments demonstrate that HCS achieves superior performance and universality in various tasks."

Although diffusion models have made significant progress in dataset distillation, the generated surrogate datasets often contain samples with label inconsistencies or insufficient structural detail, leading to suboptimal downstream performance. To address these issues, we propose a detector-guided dataset distillation framework that explicitly leverages a pre-trained detector to identify and refine anomalous synthetic samples, thereby ensuring label consistency and improving image quality. Specifically, a detector model trained on the original dataset is employed to identify anomalous images exhibiting label mismatches or low classification confidence. For each defective image, multiple candidates are generated using a pre-trained diffusion model conditioned on the corresponding image prototype and label. The optimal candidate is then selected by jointly considering the detector's confidence score and dissimilarity to existing qualified synthetic samples, thereby ensuring both label accuracy and intra-class diversity. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can synthesize high-quality representative images with richer details, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the validation set."

As a result, the overall computational cost of the model increases, hindering real-time performance.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel cost-volume-based motion feature representation, Channel-wise Motion Features. By extracting depth features of each instance in the feature map and capturing the scene's 3D motion information, it offers enhanced efficiency. The only subnetwork used to build Channel-wise Motion Features is the Pose Network, and no others are required.

The absence of ground truths for unknown objects makes OWOD tasks particularly challenging. Many methods have addressed this by using pseudo-labels for unknown objects. The recently proposed Probabilistic Objectness transformer-based open-world detector (PROB) is a state-of-the-art model that does not require pseudo-labels for unknown objects, as it predicts probabilistic objectness. However, this method faces issues with learning conflicts between objectness and class predictions.\n  To address this issue and further enhance performance, we propose a novel model, Decoupled PROB. Decoupled PROB introduces Early Termination of Objectness Prediction (ETOP) to stop objectness predictions at appropriate layers in the decoder, resolving the learning conflicts between class and objectness predictions in PROB. Additionally, we introduce Task-Decoupled Query Initialization (TDQI), which efficiently extracts features of known and unknown objects, thereby improving performance. TDQI is a query initialization method that combines query selection and learnable queries, and it is a module that can be easily integrated into existing DETR-based OWOD models.

(2) To mitigate overfitting, these methods typically rely on complex task-specific model architectures and sensitive hyperparameter tuning, severely restricting their general applicability.

However, it is highly susceptible to intrinsic signal errors and human-induced labeling errors, which lead to label noise and ultimately degrade model performance. To enhance EEG learning, multimodal knowledge distillation (KD) has been explored to transfer knowledge from visual models with rich representations to EEG-based models. Nevertheless, KD faces two key challenges: modality gap and soft label misalignment. The former arises from the heterogeneous nature of EEG and visual feature spaces, while the latter stems from label inconsistencies that create discrepancies between ground truth labels and distillation targets. This paper addresses semantic uncertainty caused by ambiguous features and weakly defined labels. We propose a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation framework that mitigates both modality and label inconsistencies. It aligns feature semantics through a prototype-based similarity module and introduces a task-specific distillation head to resolve label-induced inconsistency in supervision. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach improves EEG-based emotion regression and classification performance, outperforming both unimodal and multimodal baselines on a public multimodal dataset.

Intra-voxel incoherent motion analysis has shown promising results for non-invasive assessment of fetal lung development, but its reliance on manual segmentation is time-consuming, thus limiting its clinical applicability. In this work, we present an automated lung maturity evaluation pipeline for diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images that consists of a deep learning-based fetal lung segmentation model and a model-fitting lung maturity assessment. A 3D nnU-Net model was trained on manually segmented images selected from the baseline frames of 4D diffusion-weighted MRI scans. The segmentation model demonstrated robust performance, yielding a mean Dice coefficient of 82.14%. Next, voxel-wise model fitting was performed based on both the nnU-Net-predicted and manual lung segmentations to quantify IVIM parameters reflecting tissue microstructure and perfusion. The results suggested no differences between the two. Our work shows that a fully automated pipeline is possible for supporting fetal lung maturity assessment and clinical decision-making."

Existing approaches for continual visual concept learning are constrained by two fundamental challenges: catastrophic forgetting and parameter expansion. In this paper, we propose Redundancy-Removal Mixture of Experts (R^2MoE), a parameter-efficient framework for lifelong visual concept learning that effectively learns new concepts while incurring minimal parameter overhead. Our framework includes three key innovative contributions: First, we propose a mixture-of-experts framework with a routing distillation mechanism that enables experts to acquire concept-specific knowledge while preserving the gating network's routing capability, thereby effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Second, we propose a strategy for eliminating redundant layer-wise experts that reduces the number of expert parameters by fully utilizing previously learned experts. Third, we employ a hierarchical local attention-guided inference approach to mitigate interference between generated visual concepts. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our method generates images with superior conceptual fidelity compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, achieving an impressive 87.8\\% reduction in forgetting rates and 63.3\\% fewer parameters on the CustomConcept 101 dataset.

However, their dense and irregular nature imposes significant challenges, including high computational cost, sensitivity to spatial misalignment, and difficulty in capturing localized structural differences. This paper introduces a registration-based anomaly detection framework that combines multi-prototype alignment with cluster-wise discrepancy analysis to enable precise 3D anomaly localization. Specifically, each test sample is first registered to multiple normal prototypes to enable direct structural comparison. To evaluate anomalies at a local level, clustering is performed over the point cloud, and similarity is computed between features from the test sample and the prototypes within each cluster. Rather than selecting cluster centroids randomly, a keypoint-guided strategy is employed, where geometrically informative points are chosen as centroids. This ensures that clusters are centered on feature-rich regions, enabling more meaningful and stable distance-based comparisons. Extensive experiments on the Real3D-AD benchmark demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both object-level and point-level anomaly detection, even using only raw features."

The detection task is challenging due to the small size of the targets and their sparse distribution in infrared small target datasets. Although existing IRSTD methods and datasets have led to significant advancements, they are limited by their reliance solely on the image modality. Recent advances in deep learning and large vision-language models have shown remarkable performance in various visual recognition tasks. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal IRSTD framework that incorporates language priors to guide small target detection. We leverage language-guided attention weights derived from the language prior to enhance the model's ability for IRSTD, presenting a novel approach that combines textual information with image data to improve IRSTD capabilities. Utilizing the state-of-the-art GPT-4 vision model, we generate text descriptions that provide the locations of small targets in infrared images, employing careful prompt engineering to ensure improved accuracy. Due to the absence of multimodal IR datasets, existing IRSTD methods rely solely on image data. To address this shortcoming, we have curated a multimodal infrared dataset that includes both image and text modalities for small target detection, expanding upon the popular IRSTD-1k and NUDT-SIRST datasets. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments and comprehensive ablation studies. The results demonstrate significant improvements over the state-of-the-art method, with relative percentage differences of 9.74%, 13.02%, 1.25%, and 67.87% in IoU, nIoU, Pd, and Fa on the NUAA-SIRST subset, and 4.41%, 2.04%, 2.01%, and 113.43% on the IRSTD-1k subset of the LangIR dataset, respectively."

Despite numerous efforts devoted, mainstream detectors still underperform in such scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce RS-TinyNet, a multi-stage feature fusion and enhancement model explicitly tailored for RS tiny object detection in various RS scenarios. RS-TinyNet comes with two novel designs: tiny object saliency modeling and feature integrity reconstruction. Guided by these principles, we design three step-wise feature enhancement modules. Among them, the multi-dimensional collaborative attention (MDCA) module employs multi-dimensional attention to enhance the saliency of tiny objects. Additionally, the auxiliary reversible branch (ARB) and a progressive fusion detection head (PFDH) module are introduced to preserve information flow and fuse multi-level features to bridge semantic gaps and retain structural detail. Comprehensive experiments on public RS dataset AI-TOD show that our RS-TinyNet surpasses existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) detectors by 4.0% AP and 6.5% AP75. Evaluations on DIOR benchmark dataset further validate its superior detection performance in diverse RS scenarios. These results demonstrate that the proposed multi-stage feature fusion strategy offers an effective and practical solution for tiny object detection in complex RS environments."

To address this challenge, we propose the Neural Graph Topic Model (NGTM), a novel generative framework inspired by topic modeling in natural language processing. NGTM represents graphs as mixtures of latent topics, each defining a distribution over semantically meaningful substructures, which facilitates explicit interpretability at both local and global scales. The generation process transparently integrates these topic distributions with a global structural variable, enabling clear semantic tracing of each generated graph. Experiments demonstrate that NGTM achieves competitive generation quality while uniquely enabling fine-grained control and interpretability, allowing users to tune structural features or induce biological properties through topic-level adjustments."

Using a Generalized Linear Mixed Model, we quantify this inf luence, finding that while statistically present, demographic factors account for a minor fraction ( 8%) of the observed variance, with tweet content being the dominant factor. We then assess the reliability of Generative AI (GenAI) models as annotators, specifically evaluating if guiding them with demographic personas improves alignment with human judgments. Our results indicate that simplistic persona prompting often fails to enhance, and sometimes degrades, performance compared to baseline models. Furthermore, explainable AI (XAI) techniques reveal that model predictions rely heavily on content-specific tokens related to sexism, rather than correlates of demographic characteristics. We argue that focusing on content-driven explanations and robust annotation protocols offers a more reliable path towards fairness than potentially persona simulation."

In this paper, we present DINO-VO, a feature-based VO system leveraging DINOv2 visual foundation model for its sparse feature matching. To address the integration challenge, we propose a salient keypoints detector tailored to DINOv2's coarse features. Furthermore, we complement DINOv2's robust-semantic features with fine-grained geometric features, resulting in more localizable representations. Finally, a transformer-based matcher and differentiable pose estimation layer enable precise camera motion estimation by learning good matches. Against prior detector-descriptor networks like SuperPoint, DINO-VO demonstrates greater robustness in challenging environments. Furthermore, we show superior accuracy and generalization of the proposed feature descriptors against standalone DINOv2 coarse features. DINO-VO outperforms prior frame-to-frame VO methods on the TartanAir and KITTI datasets and is competitive on EuRoC dataset, while running efficiently at 72 FPS with less than 1GB of memory usage on a single GPU.

To address this, we drew inspiration from the evolution capabilities of natural agents, and proposed a self-evolving VLN framework (SE-VLN) to endow VLN agents with the ability to continuously evolve during testing. To the best of our knowledge, it was the first time that an multimodal LLM-powered self-evolving VLN framework was proposed.

Comprehensive tests illustrated that the SE-VLN achieved navigation success rates of 57% and 35.2% in unseen environments, representing absolute performance improvements of 23.9% and 15.0% over current state-of-the-art methods on R2R and REVERSE datasets, respectively.

This work introduces Spectral Bellman Representation, a novel framework derived from the Inherent Bellman Error (IBE) condition, which aligns with the fundamental structure of Bellman updates across a space of possible value functions, therefore, directly towards value-based RL. Our key insight is the discovery of a fundamental spectral relationship: under the zero-IBE condition, the transformation of a distribution of value functions by the Bellman operator is intrinsically linked to the feature covariance structure. This spectral connection yields a new, theoretically-grounded objective for learning state-action features that inherently capture this Bellman-aligned covariance. Our method requires a simple modification to existing algorithms. We demonstrate that our learned representations enable structured exploration, by aligning feature covariance with Bellman dynamics, and improve overall performance, particularly in challenging hard-exploration and long-horizon credit assignment tasks. Our framework naturally extends to powerful multi-step Bellman operators, further broadening its impact.

However, teachers in large preschool classrooms struggle to accurately identify students who require intervention. We present a system for automatically assessing oral narratives of preschool children in Afrikaans and isiXhosa. The system uses automatic speech recognition followed by a machine learning scoring model to predict narrative and comprehension scores. For scoring predicted transcripts, we compare a linear model to a large language model (LLM). The LLM-based system outperforms the linear model in most cases, but the linear system is competitive despite its simplicity. The LLM-based system is comparable to a human expert in flagging children who require intervention. We lay the foundation for automatic oral assessments in classrooms, giving teachers extra capacity to focus on personalised support for children's learning."

Yet, the crucial task of out-of-domain imputation of missing values remains largely underexplored. We propose a first step to fill this gap by leveraging implicit neural representations (INRs). INRs model time series as continuous functions and naturally handle various missing data scenarios and sampling rates. While they have shown strong performance within specific distributions, they struggle under distribution shifts. To address this, we introduce MoTM (Mixture of Timeflow Models), a step toward a foundation model for time series imputation. Building on the idea that a new time series is a mixture of previously seen patterns, MoTM combines a basis of INRs, each trained independently on a distinct family of time series, with a ridge regressor that adapts to the observed context at inference. We demonstrate robust in-domain and out-of-domain generalization across diverse imputation scenarios (e.g., block and pointwise missingness, variable sampling rates), paving the way for adaptable foundation imputation models."

As AI-generated visual content becomes increasingly indistinguishable from real content, the challenge of detecting the generated content becomes critical in combating misinformation, ensuring privacy, and preventing security threats. Although there has been substantial progress in detecting AI-generated images, current methods for video detection are largely focused on deepfakes, which primarily involve human faces. However, the field of video generation has advanced beyond DeepFakes, creating an urgent need for methods capable of detecting AI-generated videos with generic content. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach that leverages pre-trained visual models to distinguish between real and generated videos. The features extracted from these pre-trained models, which have been trained on extensive real visual content, contain inherent signals that can help distinguish real from generated videos. Using these extracted features, we achieve high detection performance without requiring additional model training, and we further improve performance by training a simple linear classification layer on top of the extracted features. We validated our method on a dataset we compiled (VID-AID), which includes around 10,000 AI-generated videos produced by 9 different text-to-video models, along with 4,000 real videos, totaling over 7 hours of video content. Our evaluation shows that our approach achieves high detection accuracy, above 90% on average, underscoring its effectiveness. Upon acceptance, we plan to publicly release the code, the pre-trained models, and our dataset to support ongoing research in this critical area."

Iterative local search methods achieve high scores on constrained benchmarks, but their core mechanism inherently limits the global consistency required for true generalization. On the other hand, global matching architectures, while theoretically more robust, have been historically rendered infeasible by prohibitive computational and memory costs. We resolve this dilemma with $S^2M^2$: a global matching architecture that achieves both state-of-the-art accuracy and high efficiency without relying on cost volume filtering or deep refinement stacks. Our design integrates a multi-resolution transformer for robust long-range correspondence, trained with a novel loss function that concentrates probability on feasible matches. This approach enables a more robust joint estimation of disparity, occlusion, and confidence. $S^2M^2$ establishes a new state of the art on the Middlebury v3 and ETH3D benchmarks, significantly outperforming prior methods across most metrics while reconstructing high-quality details with competitive efficiency."

Traditional flow matching and diffusion policies sample from standard source distributions (e.g., Gaussian noise) and require additional conditioning mechanisms like cross-attention to condition action generation on visual information, creating time and space overheads. VITA proposes a novel paradigm that treats latent images as the flow source, learning an inherent mapping from vision to action while eliminating separate conditioning modules and preserving generative modeling capabilities. Learning flows between fundamentally different modalities like vision and action is challenging due to sparse action data lacking semantic structures and dimensional mismatches between high-dimensional visual representations and raw actions. We address this by creating a structured action latent space via an autoencoder as the flow matching target, up-sampling raw actions to match visual representation shapes. Crucially, we supervise flow matching with both encoder targets and final action outputs through flow latent decoding, which backpropagates action reconstruction loss through sequential flow matching ODE solving steps for effective end-to-end learning. Implemented as simple MLP layers, VITA is evaluated on challenging bi-manual manipulation tasks on the ALOHA platform, including 5 simulation and 2 real-world tasks. Despite its simplicity, MLP-only VITA outperforms or matches state-of-the-art generative policies while reducing inference latency by 50-130% compared to conventional flow matching policies requiring different conditioning mechanisms or complex architectures. To our knowledge, VITA is the first MLP-only flow matching policy capable of solving complex bi-manual manipulation tasks like those in ALOHA benchmarks."

In this paper, we investigate whether cross-task transfer can be achieved via latent space steering without parameter updates or input expansion. Through an analysis of activation patterns in the latent space of LLMs, we observe that the enhanced activations induced by in-context examples have consistent patterns across different tasks. Inspired by these findings, we propose CAST, a novel Cross-task Activation Steering Transfer framework that enables effective transfer by manipulating the model's internal activation states. Our approach first selects influential and diverse samples from high-resource tasks, then utilizes their contrastive representation-enhanced activations to adapt LLMs to low-resource tasks. Extensive experiments across both cross-domain and cross-lingual transfer settings show that our method outperforms competitive baselines and demonstrates superior scalability and lower computational costs."

In this paper, we investigate whether asynchronously published prices as a result of differing gate closure times (GCTs) in some bidding zones can improve forecasting accuracy in other markets with later GCTs. Using a state-of-the-art ensemble of models, we show significant improvements of 22% and 9% in forecast accuracy in the Belgian (BE) and Swedish bidding zones (SE3) respectively, when including price data from interconnected markets with earlier GCT (Germany-Luxembourg, Austria, and Switzerland). This improvement holds for both general as well as extreme market conditions. Our analysis also yields further important insights: frequent model recalibration is necessary for maximum accuracy but comes at substantial additional computational costs, and using data from more markets does not always lead to better performance - a fact we delve deeper into with interpretability analysis of the forecast models. Overall, these findings provide valuable guidance for market participants and decision-makers aiming to optimize bidding strategies within increasingly interconnected and volatile European energy markets."

These low-rank matrices are commonly derived through the multiplication structure of down-projection and up-projection matrices, exemplified by methods such as LoRA and Adapter. In this work, we observe an approximate orthogonality among any two row or column vectors within any weight matrix of the backbone parameters; however, this property is absent in the vectors of the down/up-projection matrices. Approximate orthogonality implies a reduction in the upper bound of the model's generalization error, signifying that the model possesses enhanced generalization capability. If the fine-tuned down/up-projection matrices were to exhibit this same property as the pre-trained backbone matrices, could the generalization capability of fine-tuned ViTs be further augmented? To address this question, we propose an Approximately Orthogonal Fine-Tuning (AOFT) strategy for representing the low-rank weight matrices. This strategy employs a single learnable vector to generate a set of approximately orthogonal vectors, which form the down/up-projection matrices, thereby aligning the properties of these matrices with those of the backbone. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance across a range of downstream image classification tasks, confirming the efficacy of the enhanced generalization capability embedded in the down/up-projection matrices."

The current state-of-the-art BO approach for permutation spaces relies on the Mallows kernel-an $\\Omega(n^2)$ representation that explicitly enumerates every pairwise comparison. Inspired by the close relationship between the Mallows kernel and pairwise comparison, we propose a novel framework for generating kernel functions on permutation space based on sorting algorithms. Within this framework, the Mallows kernel can be viewed as a special instance derived from bubble sort. Further, we introduce the \\textbf{Merge Kernel} constructed from merge sort, which replaces the quadratic complexity with $\\Theta(n\\log n)$ to achieve the lowest possible complexity. The resulting feature vector is significantly shorter, can be computed in linearithmic time, yet still efficiently captures meaningful permutation distances. To boost robustness and right-invariance without sacrificing compactness, we further incorporate three lightweight, task-agnostic descriptors: (1) a shift histogram, which aggregates absolute element displacements and supplies a global misplacement signal; (2) a split-pair line, which encodes selected long-range comparisons by aligning elements across the two halves of the whole permutation; and (3) sliding-window motifs, which summarize local order patterns that influence near-neighbor objectives. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that the proposed kernel consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art Mallows kernel across various permutation optimization benchmarks. Results confirm that the Merge Kernel provides a more compact yet more effective solution for Bayesian optimization in permutation space."

        "summary": "arXiv:2507.13305v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Team modeling remains a fundamental challenge at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and the Social Sciences. Social Science research emphasizes the need to jointly model dynamics and relations, while practical applications demand unified models capable of inferring multiple team constructs simultaneously, providing interpretable insights and actionable recommendations to enhance team performance. However, existing works do not meet these practical demands. To bridge this gap, we present TRENN, a novel tempo-relational architecture that integrates: (i) an automatic temporal graph extractor, (ii) a tempo-relational encoder, (iii) a decoder for team construct prediction, and (iv) two complementary explainability modules. TRENN jointly captures relational and temporal team dynamics, providing a solid foundation for MT-TRENN, which extends TReNN by replacing the decoder with a multi-task head, enabling the model to learn shared Social Embeddings and simultaneously predict multiple team constructs, including Emergent Leadership, Leadership Style, and Teamwork components. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms approaches that rely exclusively on temporal or relational information. Additionally, experimental evaluation has shown that the explainability modules integrated in MT-TRENN yield interpretable insights and actionable suggestions to support team improvement. These capabilities make our approach particularly well-suited for Human-Centered AI applications, such as intelligent decision-support systems in high-stakes collaborative environments."

To address this, we introduce FashionPose, the first unified text-to-pose-to-relighting generation framework. Given a natural language description, our method first predicts a 2D human pose, then employs a diffusion model to generate high-fidelity person images, and finally applies a lightweight relighting module, all guided by the same textual input.

Most notably, the benchmark utilizes different image indices from those of the original 3DPW dataset, forcing researchers into tedious and error-prone manual matching processes to obtain accurate ground-truth (GT) annotations for quantitative metrics (\\eg, MPJPE, PA-MPJPE). Furthermore, our analysis reveals several inherent benchmark-quality limitations, including significant image redundancy, scenario imbalance, overly simplistic poses, and ambiguous textual descriptions, collectively undermining reliable evaluations across diverse scenarios.

To advance this area, we create HapticCap, the first fully human-annotated haptic-captioned dataset, containing 92,070 haptic-text pairs for user descriptions of sensory, emotional, and associative attributes of vibrations. Based on HapticCap, we propose the haptic-caption retrieval task and present the results of this task from a supervised contrastive learning framework that brings together text representations within specific categories and vibrations. Overall, the combination of language model T5 and audio model AST yields the best performance in the haptic-caption retrieval task, especially when separately trained for each description category."

Our approach leverages the prior knowledge of large language model (LLM) to address the scarcity of labeled data, with the LLM functioning as a data engineer by extracting informative features to enable effective estimation in few-shot settings. Specifically, our model obtains contextual relationships between data features and the target indicator, categorizing their correlations as positive, negative, mixed, or irrelevant. These features are then fed into the linear estimator with tailored weight constraints for each category. To capture nonlinear patterns, the model also identifies meaningful feature interactions and integrates them, along with nonlinear transformations. Experiments across three countries at different stages of development demonstrate that our model outperforms baselines in estimating socio-economic indicators, even for low-income countries with limited data availability."

This study analyzes the outputs of major search engines using a dataset of political and social topics. The findings reveal that search engines not only prioritize content in ways that reflect underlying biases but also that ideologically-driven user queries exacerbate these biases, resulting in the amplification of specific narratives. Moreover, significant differences were observed across search engines in terms of the sources they prioritize.

In this work, we start from the hypothesis that the domain in which VL training could have a significant effect is lexical-conceptual knowledge, in particular its taxonomic organization. Through comparing minimal pairs of text-only LMs and their VL-trained counterparts, we first show that the VL models often outperform their text-only counterparts on a text-only question-answering task that requires taxonomic understanding of concepts mentioned in the questions. Using an array of targeted behavioral and representational analyses, we show that the LMs and VLMs do not differ significantly in terms of their taxonomic knowledge itself, but they differ in how they represent questions that contain concepts in a taxonomic relation vs. a non-taxonomic relation. This implies that the taxonomic knowledge itself does not change substantially through additional VL training, but VL training does improve the deployment of this knowledge in the context of a specific task, even when the presentation of the task is purely linguistic."

Although existing studies have predominantly focused on data-driven approaches for arithmetic operations and symbolic manipulation tasks, these approaches tend to be task-specific with limited overall performance. To pursue a more general solution, this paper focuses on a broader case of reasoning problems that are computable, i.e., problems that algorithms can solve, thus can be solved by the Turing Machine. From this perspective, this paper proposes Turing MAchine Imitation Learning (TAIL) to improve the length generalization ability of LLMs. TAIL synthesizes chain-of-thoughts (CoT) data that imitate the execution process of a Turing Machine by computer programs, which linearly expands the reasoning steps into atomic states to alleviate shortcut learning and explicit memory fetch mechanism to reduce the difficulties of dynamic and long-range data access in elementary operations. To validate the reliability and universality of TAIL, we construct a challenging synthetic dataset covering 8 classes of algorithms and 18 tasks. Without bells and whistles, TAIL significantly improves the length generalization ability as well as the performance of Qwen2.5-7B on various tasks using only synthetic data, surpassing previous methods and DeepSeek-R1. The experimental results reveal that the key concepts in the Turing Machine, instead of the thinking styles, are indispensable for TAIL for length generalization, through which the model exhibits read-and-write behaviors consistent with the properties of the Turing Machine in their attention layers. This work provides a promising direction for future research in the learning of LLM reasoning from synthetic data."

Through this systematic analysis of over 1300 research papers, our survey not only establishes a technical roadmap for the field but also reveals a critical research gap: a fundamental asymmetry exists between model capabilities.

We compare models on simple puns and more complex topical humour that requires knowledge of real-world entities and events. In doing so, we curate a dataset of 600 jokes split across 4 joke types and manually write high-quality explanations. These jokes include heterographic and homographic puns, contemporary internet humour, and topical jokes, where understanding relies on reasoning beyond \"common sense\", rooted instead in world knowledge regarding news events and pop culture. Using this dataset, we compare the zero-shot abilities of a range of LLMs to accurately and comprehensively explain jokes of different types, identifying key research gaps in the task of humour explanation. We find that none of the tested models (inc. reasoning models) are capable of reliably generating adequate explanations of all joke types, further highlighting the narrow focus of most works in computational humour on overly simple joke forms."

This sensitivity has been linked to pathologies such as vulnerability to adversarial examples, divergent training, and overfitting. To combat these problems, past research has looked at building neural networks entirely from Lipschitz components. However, these techniques have not matured to the point where researchers have trained a modern architecture such as a transformer with a Lipschitz certificate enforced beyond initialization. To explore this gap, we begin by developing and benchmarking novel, computationally-efficient tools for maintaining norm-constrained weight matrices. Applying these tools, we are able to train transformer models with Lipschitz bounds enforced throughout training. We find that optimizer dynamics matter: switching from AdamW to Muon improves standard methods -- weight decay and spectral normalization -- allowing models to reach equal performance with a lower Lipschitz bound. Inspired by Muon's update having a fixed spectral norm, we co-design a weight constraint method that improves the Lipschitz vs. performance tradeoff on MLPs and 2M parameter transformers. Our 2-Lipschitz transformer on Shakespeare text reaches validation accuracy 60%. Scaling to 145M parameters, our 10-Lipschitz transformer reaches 21% accuracy on internet text. However, to match the NanoGPT baseline validation accuracy of 39.4%, our Lipschitz upper bound increases to 10^264. Nonetheless, our Lipschitz transformers train without stability measures such as layer norm, QK norm, and logit tanh softcapping."

However, the generated videos from these models often lack spatio-temporal consistency, thus degrading view synthesis quality. In this paper, we propose a novel sliding iterative denoising process to enhance the spatio-temporal consistency of the 4D diffusion model. Specifically, we define a latent grid in which each latent encodes the image, camera pose, and human pose for a certain viewpoint and timestamp, then alternately denoising the latent grid along spatial and temporal dimensions with a sliding window, and finally decode the videos at target viewpoints from the corresponding denoised latents. Through the iterative sliding, information flows sufficiently across the latent grid, allowing the diffusion model to obtain a large receptive field and thus enhance the 4D consistency of the output, while making the GPU memory consumption affordable. The experiments on the DNA-Rendering and ActorsHQ datasets demonstrate that our method is able to synthesize high-quality and consistent novel-view videos and significantly outperforms the existing approaches.

However, we observe that most real-world scenarios do not require such an extensive number of visual tokens. While the performance drops significantly in a small subset of OCR-related tasks, models still perform accurately in most other general VQA tasks with only 1/4 resolution. Therefore, we propose to dynamically process distinct samples with different resolutions, and present a new paradigm for visual token compression, namely, VisionThink. It starts with a downsampled image and smartly decides whether it is sufficient for problem solving. Otherwise, the model could output a special token to request the higher-resolution image. Compared to existing Efficient VLM methods that compress tokens using fixed pruning ratios or thresholds, VisionThink autonomously decides whether to compress tokens case by case. As a result, it demonstrates strong fine-grained visual understanding capability on OCR-related tasks, and meanwhile saves substantial visual tokens on simpler tasks. We adopt reinforcement learning and propose the LLM-as-Judge strategy to successfully apply RL to general VQA tasks.

To generate data via a flow matching model, an ordinary differential equation (ODE) is numerically solved via forward integration of the modeled velocity field. To better capture the multi-modality that is inherent in typical velocity fields, hierarchical flow matching was recently introduced. It uses a hierarchy of ODEs that are numerically integrated when generating data. This hierarchy of ODEs captures the multi-modal velocity distribution just like vanilla flow matching is capable of modeling a multi-modal data distribution. While this hierarchy enables to model multi-modal velocity distributions, the complexity of the modeled distribution remains identical across levels of the hierarchy. In this paper, we study how to gradually adjust the complexity of the distributions across different levels of the hierarchy via mini-batch couplings. We show the benefits of mini-batch couplings in hierarchical rectified flow matching via compelling results on synthetic and imaging data.

Current methods, such as reducing inter-frame redundancy, employing separate models for image-text relevance assessment, or utilizing temporal video grounding for event localization, substantially adopt unsupervised learning paradigms, whereas they struggle to address the complex scenarios in long video understanding. We propose Instructed Temporal Grounding for Videos (VideoITG), featuring customized frame sampling aligned with user instructions. The core of VideoITG is the VidThinker pipeline, an automated annotation framework that explicitly mimics the human annotation process. First, it generates detailed clip-level captions conditioned on the instruction; then, it retrieves relevant video segments through instruction-guided reasoning; finally, it performs fine-grained frame selection to pinpoint the most informative visual evidence. Leveraging VidThinker, we construct the VideoITG-40K dataset, containing 40K videos and 500K instructed temporal grounding annotations. We then design a plug-and-play VideoITG model, which takes advantage of visual language alignment and reasoning capabilities of Video-LLMs, for effective frame selection in a discriminative manner. Coupled with Video-LLMs, VideoITG achieves consistent performance improvements across multiple multimodal video understanding benchmarks, showing its superiority and great potentials for video understanding."

However, the high computational costs associated with All-Atom (AA) MD simulations have led to the development of Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics (CGMD), providing a lower-dimensional compression of the AA structure into representative CG beads, offering reduced computational expense at the cost of predictive accuracy. Existing CGMD methods, such as CG-Martini (calibrated against experimental data), aim to generate an embedding of a topology that sufficiently generalizes across a range of structures. Detrimentally, in attempting to specify parameterization with applicability across molecular classes, it is unable to specialize to domain-specific applications, where sufficient accuracy and computational speed are critical. This work presents a novel approach to optimize derived results from CGMD simulations by refining the general-purpose Martini3 topologies specifically the bonded interaction parameters within a given coarse-grained mapping - for domain-specific applications using Bayesian Optimization methodologies. We have developed and validated a CG potential applicable to any degree of polymerization, representing a significant advancement in the field. Our optimized CG potential, based on the Martini3 framework, aims to achieve accuracy comparable to AAMD while maintaining the computational efficiency of CGMD. This approach bridges the gap between efficiency and accuracy in multiscale molecular simulations, potentially enabling more rapid and cost-effective molecular discovery across various scientific and technological domains."

In microbiome models, it is important to consider both the local dynamics within an environment and exchanges of microbiomes between environments. One way to incorporate these and other interactions across multiple scales is to employ metacommunity theory. Metacommunity models commonly assume continuous microbiome dispersal between the environments in which local microbiome dynamics occur. Under this assumption, a single parameter between each pair of environments controls the dispersal rate between those environments. This metacommunity framework is well-suited to abiotic environmental patches, but it fails to capture an essential aspect of the microbiomes of living hosts, which generally do not interact continuously with each other. Instead, living hosts interact with each other in discrete time intervals. In this paper, we develop a modeling framework that encodes such discrete interactions and uses two parameters to separately control the interaction frequencies between hosts and the amount of microbiome exchange during each interaction. We derive analytical approximations of models in our framework in three parameter regimes and prove that they are accurate in those regimes. We compare these approximations to numerical simulations for an illustrative model. We demonstrate that both parameters in our modeling framework are necessary to determine microbiome dynamics. Key features of the dynamics, such as microbiome convergence across hosts, depend sensitively on the interplay between interaction frequency and strength."

In the other direction, we show that if there is no requirement for the network to match any score function, then diffusion modeling can simulate any Turing machine in a certain sense. This dichotomy provides a theoretical lens on the capabilities and limitations of diffusion models, particularly concerning tasks requiring sequential computation. We conjecture extensions of our theoretical results, including for the case where the diffusion model is not perfect, but merely good.

This review explores an AI architectural path inspired by the brain's structure, particularly the minicolumn hypothesis, which views the neocortex as a distributed system of repeated modules - a structure we connect to collective intelligence (CI). Despite existing work, there is a lack of comprehensive reviews connecting the cortical column to the architectures of repeated neural modules. This review aims to fill that gap by synthesizing historical, theoretical, and methodological perspectives on neural module repetition. We distinguish between architectural repetition - reusing structure - and parameter-shared module repetition, where the same functional unit is repeated across a network. The latter exhibits key CI properties such as robustness, adaptability, and generalization. Evidence suggests that the repeated module tends to converge toward a generalist module: simple, flexible problem solvers capable of handling many roles in the ensemble. This generalist tendency may offer solutions to longstanding challenges in modern AI: improved energy efficiency during training through simplicity and scalability, and robust embodied control via generalization. While empirical results suggest such systems can generalize to out-of-distribution problems, theoretical results are still lacking. Overall, architectures featuring module repetition remain an emerging and unexplored architectural strategy, with significant untapped potential for both efficiency, robustness, and adaptiveness. We believe that a system that adopts the benefits of CI, while adhering to architectural and functional principles of the minicolumns, could challenge the modern AI problems of scalability, energy consumption, and democratization."

Since there is a limited amount of approaches in this direction, in this work we deliver a general DP approach for CP that we call Private Conformity via Quantile Search (P-COQS). The proposed approach adapts an existing randomized binary search algorithm for computing DP quantiles in the calibration phase of CP thereby guaranteeing privacy of the consequent prediction sets. This however comes at a price of slightly under-covering with respect to the desired $(1 - \\alpha)$-level when using finite-sample calibration sets (although broad empirical results show that the P-COQS generally targets the required level in the considered cases). Confirming properties of the adapted algorithm and quantifying the approximate coverage guarantees of the consequent CP, we conduct extensive experiments to examine the effects of privacy noise, sample size and significance level on the performance of our approach compared to existing alternatives. In addition, we empirically evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets, including CIFAR-10, ImageNet and CoronaHack. Our results suggest that the proposed method is robust to privacy noise and performs favorably with respect to the current DP alternative in terms of empirical coverage, efficiency, and informativeness.

To address these issues simultaneously, we propose a novel decoupled optimization framework, which integrates wavelet decomposition into 3D Gaussian Splatting and 2D sampling. Technically, through 3D wavelet decomposition, our approach divides point clouds into high-frequency and low-frequency components, enabling targeted optimization for each. The low-frequency component captures global structural outlines and manages the distribution of Gaussians through voxelization. In contrast, the high-frequency component restores intricate geometric and textural details while incorporating a relight module to mitigate lighting artifacts and enhance photorealistic rendering. Additionally, a 2D wavelet decomposition is applied to the training images, simulating radiance variations. This provides critical guidance for high-frequency detail reconstruction, ensuring seamless integration of details with the global structure.

        "summary": "arXiv:2507.12562v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Relational databases (RDBs) are ubiquitous in enterprise and real-world applications. Flattening the database poses challenges for deep learning models that rely on fixed-size input representations to capture relational semantics from the structured nature of relational data. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been proposed to address this, but they often oversimplify relational structures by modeling all the tuples as monolithic nodes and ignoring intra-tuple associations. In this work, we propose a novel hypergraph-based framework, that we call rel-HNN, which models each unique attribute-value pair as a node and each tuple as a hyperedge, enabling the capture of fine-grained intra-tuple relationships. Our approach learns explicit multi-level representations across attribute-value, tuple, and table levels. To address the scalability challenges posed by large RDBs, we further introduce a split-parallel training algorithm that leverages multi-GPU execution for efficient hypergraph learning. Extensive experiments on real-world and benchmark datasets demonstrate that rel-HNN significantly outperforms existing methods in both classification and regression tasks. Moreover, our split-parallel training achieves substantial speedups -- up to 3.18x for learning on relational data and up to 2.94x for hypergraph learning -- compared to conventional single-GPU execution."

While Koopman operator theory offers a framework for deploying powerful linear control techniques, learning a finite-dimensional invariant subspace for high-fidelity modeling continues to be an open problem. This paper presents a deep Koopman approach for modeling and control of vehicle dynamics within the curvilinear Frenet frame. The proposed framework uses a deep neural network architecture to simultaneously learn the Koopman operator and its associated invariant subspace from the data. Input-state bilinear interactions are captured by the algorithm while preserving convexity, which makes it suitable for real-time model predictive control (MPC) application. A multi-step prediction loss is utilized during training to ensure long-horizon prediction capability. To further enhance real-time trajectory tracking performance, the model is integrated with a cumulative error regulator (CER) module, which compensates for model mismatch by mitigating accumulated prediction errors. Closed-loop performance is evaluated through hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experiments using a CarSim RT model as the target plant, with real-time validation conducted on a dSPACE SCALEXIO system. The proposed controller achieved significant reductions in tracking error relative to baseline controllers, confirming its suitability for real-time implementation in embedded autonomous vehicle systems."

Expert pathology reviews have also been used, but they are inherently subjective and time-consuming.\n  In this study, we introduce PaPIS (Pathology-Aware Perceptual Image Similarity), a novel FR-IQA metric specifically tailored for virtual staining evaluation. PaPIS leverages deep learning-based features trained on cell morphology segmentation and incorporates Retinex-inspired feature decomposition to better reflect histological perceptual quality. Comparative experiments demonstrate that PaPIS more accurately aligns with pathology-relevant visual cues and distinguishes subtle cellular structures that traditional and existing perceptual metrics tend to overlook. Furthermore, integrating PaPIS as a guiding loss function in a virtual staining model leads to improved histological fidelity.\n  This work highlights the critical need for pathology-aware evaluation frameworks to advance the development and clinical readiness of virtual staining technologies."

Despite advances in multi-sensor fusion, a critical gap remains in developing unified architectures that effectively process and extract features from fundamentally different physiological signals. Another challenge is the inherent class imbalance in many biomedical datasets, often causing biased performance in traditional methods. This study addresses these issues by proposing a novel and unified deep learning framework that achieves state-of-the-art performance across different signal types. Our method integrates a ResNet-based CNN with an attention mechanism, enhanced by a novel data augmentation strategy: time-domain concatenation of multiple augmented variants of each signal to generate richer representations. Unlike prior work, we scientifically increase signal complexity to achieve future-reaching capabilities, which resulted in the best predictions compared to the state of the art. Preprocessing steps included wavelet denoising, baseline removal, and standardization. Class imbalance was effectively managed through the combined use of this advanced data augmentation and the Focal Loss function. Regularization techniques were applied during training to ensure generalization. We rigorously evaluated the proposed architecture on three benchmark datasets: UCI Seizure EEG, MIT-BIH Arrhythmia, and PTB Diagnostic ECG. It achieved accuracies of 99.96%, 99.78%, and 100%, respectively, demonstrating robustness across diverse signal types and clinical contexts. Finally, the architecture requires ~130 MB of memory and processes each sample in ~10 ms, suggesting suitability for deployment on low-end or wearable devices."

This enables AAR, TLA, and a robust defense against misinformation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the strong performance of our method in AAR and TLA against various manipulations, including voice cloning and lip synchronization."

Briefly, we aim to find a filter $h^*$, which applied to any music or speech, will maximize the user's satisfaction. This is a black-box optimization problem since the user's satisfaction function is unknown. Substantive work has been done on this topic where the key idea is to play audio samples to the user, each shaped by a different filter $h_i$, and query the user for their satisfaction scores $f(h_i)$. A family of ``surrogate\" functions is then designed to fit these scores and the optimization method gradually refines these functions to arrive at the filter $\\hat{h}^*$ that maximizes satisfaction. In certain applications, we observe that a second type of querying is possible where users can tell us the individual elements $h^*[j]$ of the optimal filter $h^*$. Consider an analogy from cooking where the goal is to cook a recipe that maximizes user satisfaction. A user can be asked to score various cooked recipes (e.g., tofu fried rice) or to score individual ingredients (say, salt, sugar, rice, chicken, etc.). Given a budget of $B$ queries, where a query can be of either type, our goal is to find the recipe that will maximize this user's satisfaction. Our proposal builds on Sparse Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and shows how a hybrid approach can outperform any one type of querying. Our results are validated through simulations and real world experiments, where volunteers gave feedback on music/speech audio and were able to achieve high satisfaction levels. We believe this idea of hybrid querying opens new problems in black-box optimization and solutions can benefit other applications beyond audio personalization."

Moreover, instrumental variables also influence the treatment assignment mechanism. This situation sets the study apart from a standard randomized controlled trial, where the treatment assignment is random. Due to this situation, the estimated average treatment effect becomes biased. To address this issue, a standard approach is to incorporate the estimated propensity score when estimating the average treatment effect. However, these methods incur the risk of misspecification in propensity score models. To solve this issue, a novel method called the \"Self balancing neural network\" (Sbnet), which lets the model itself obtain its pseudo propensity score from the balancing net, is proposed in this study. The proposed method estimates the average treatment effect by using the balancing net as a key part of the feedforward neural network. This formulation resolves the estimation of the average treatment effect in one step. Moreover, the multi-pseudo propensity score framework, which is estimated from the diversified balancing net and used for the estimation of the average treatment effect, is presented. Finally, the proposed methods are compared with state-of-the-art methods on three simulation setups and real-world datasets. It has been shown that the proposed self-balancing neural network shows better performance than state-of-the-art methods."

We argue that this profound adaptability is fundamentally linked to the efficient construction and refinement of internal representations of the environment, commonly referred to as world models, and we refer to this adaptation mechanism as world model induction. However, current understanding and evaluation of world models in artificial intelligence (AI) remains narrow, often focusing on static representations learned from training on a massive corpora of data, instead of the efficiency and efficacy of models in learning these representations through interaction and exploration within a novel environment. In this Perspective, we provide a view of world model induction drawing on decades of research in cognitive science on how humans learn and adapt so efficiently; we then call for a new evaluation framework for assessing adaptive world models in AI. Concretely, we propose a new benchmarking paradigm based on suites of carefully designed games with genuine, deep and continually refreshing novelty in the underlying game structures -- we refer to this kind of games as novel games. We detail key desiderata for constructing these games and propose appropriate metrics to explicitly challenge and evaluate the agent's ability for rapid world model induction. We hope that this new evaluation framework will inspire future evaluation efforts on world models in AI and provide a crucial step towards developing AI systems capable of the human-like rapid adaptation and robust generalization -- a critical component of artificial general intelligence."

While supervised regression is the primary method for speech enhancement, audio tokenization is emerging as a promising alternative for a smooth integration with other modalities. However, research on speech enhancement using discrete representations is still limited. Previous work has mainly focused on semantic tokens, which tend to discard key acoustic details such as speaker identity. Additionally, these studies typically employ non-autoregressive models, assuming conditional independence of outputs and overlooking the potential improvements offered by autoregressive modeling. To address these gaps we: 1) conduct a comprehensive study of the performance of acoustic tokens for speech enhancement, including the effect of bitrate and noise strength; 2) introduce a novel transducer-based autoregressive architecture specifically designed for this task. Experiments on VoiceBank and Libri1Mix datasets show that acoustic tokens outperform semantic tokens in terms of preserving speaker identity, and that our autoregressive approach can further improve performance. Nevertheless, we observe that discrete representations still fall short compared to continuous ones, highlighting the need for further research in this area."

To perform inference, we leverage modern machine learning techniques, including Bayesian neural networks and Gaussian Processes, using scalable variational inference. We demonstrate through a series of experiments that our framework can robustly infer the properties of an LTI system from a single noisy observation, show superior data efficiency compared to classical methods in a simulated ambient noise tomography problem, and successfully track a continuously varying LTV impulse response by using a structured Gaussian Process prior.

In microservice systems, as the number of services and the load increase, efficiently scheduling and allocating resources such as computing power, memory, and storage becomes a critical research challenge. To address this, the paper employs an intelligent scheduling algorithm based on reinforcement learning. Through the interaction between the agent and the environment, the resource allocation strategy is continuously optimized. In the experiments, the paper considers different resource conditions and load scenarios, evaluating the proposed method across multiple dimensions, including response time, throughput, resource utilization, and cost efficiency. The experimental results show that the reinforcement learning-based scheduling method significantly improves system response speed and throughput under low load and high concurrency conditions, while also optimizing resource utilization and reducing energy consumption. Under multi-dimensional resource conditions, the proposed method can consider multiple objectives and achieve optimized resource scheduling. Compared to traditional static resource allocation methods, the reinforcement learning model demonstrates stronger adaptability and optimization capability. It can adjust resource allocation strategies in real time, thereby maintaining good system performance in dynamically changing load and resource environments."

However, these gains often persist even when models are trained with flawed signals, such as random or inverted rewards, raising a fundamental question: do such improvements reflect true reasoning, or are they merely artifacts of overfitting to benchmark-specific patterns? To address this question, we take an evaluation-centric perspective and identify two critical shortcomings in existing protocols. First, \\emph{benchmark contamination} arises from the public availability of test problems, increasing the risk of data leakage. Second, \\emph{evaluation fragility} stems from the reliance on single-instance assessments, which are highly sensitive to stochastic outputs and fail to capture reasoning consistency. To overcome these limitations, we introduce {VAR-MATH}, a symbolic evaluation framework designed to probe genuine reasoning ability. By converting fixed numerical problems into symbolic templates and requiring models to solve multiple instantiations of each, VAR-MATH enforces consistent reasoning across structurally equivalent variants, thereby mitigating contamination and improving evaluation robustness. We apply VAR-MATH to transform two popular benchmarks, AMC23 and AIME24, into their symbolic counterparts, VAR-AMC23 and VAR-AIME24. Experimental results reveal substantial performance drops for RL-trained models on the variabilized versions, especially for smaller models, with average declines of 48.0\\% on AMC23 and 58.3\\% on AIME24. These findings suggest that many existing RL methods rely on superficial heuristics and fail to generalize beyond specific numerical forms. Overall, VAR-MATH offers a principled, contamination-resistant evaluation paradigm for mathematical reasoning."

Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been introduced into autonomous driving research for their promising generalization capabilities in OOD settings. Early studies demonstrated that VLMs could recognize OOD scenarios and generate user-level decisions such as \"go straight\" or \"turn right.\" However, a new challenge has emerged due to the misalignment between the VLM's high-level decisions or visual reasoning expressed in language, and the low-level predicted trajectories interpreted as actions. In this paper, we propose LaViPlan, a framework that leverages Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize VLMs using planning-oriented metrics. This approach addresses the vision-language-action misalignment observed in existing VLMs fine-tuned via supervised learning, which can recognize driving scenarios but often produce context-unaware decisions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method improves situational awareness and decision-making under OOD conditions, highlighting its potential to mitigate the misalignment issue.

In these ambiguous regions, existing segmentation approaches often output disconnected or under-segmented results. We propose a novel framework that corrects segmentation results by leveraging consensus from multiple diffusion model outputs. Our approach employs a conditional Bernoulli diffusion model trained on diverse annotation patterns per image to generate multiple plausible segmentations, followed by a consensus-driven correction that incorporates position proximity, consensus level, and gradient direction similarity to correct challenging regions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods, significantly improving recall in ambiguous regions while preserving the continuity of thin structures. Furthermore, our method automates the manual process of segmentation result correction and can be applied to image-guided surgical planning and surgery."

To bridge this gap, we introduce VLN-PE, a physically realistic VLN platform supporting humanoid, quadruped, and wheeled robots. For the first time, we systematically evaluate several ego-centric VLN methods in physical robotic settings across different technical pipelines, including classification models for single-step discrete action prediction, a diffusion model for dense waypoint prediction, and a train-free, map-based large language model (LLM) integrated with path planning. Our results reveal significant performance degradation due to limited robot observation space, environmental lighting variations, and physical challenges like collisions and falls. This also exposes locomotion constraints for legged robots in complex environments. VLN-PE is highly extensible, allowing seamless integration of new scenes beyond MP3D, thereby enabling more comprehensive VLN evaluation. Despite the weak generalization of current models in physical deployment, VLN-PE provides a new pathway for improving cross-embodiment's overall adaptability. We hope our findings and tools inspire the community to rethink VLN limitations and advance robust, practical VLN models. The code is available at https://crystalsixone.github.io/vln_pe.github.io/."

From a theoretical perspective, we prove that a Pattern-by-Pattern strategy (PbP), which learns one logistic model per missingness pattern, accurately approximates Bayes probabilities in various missing data scenarios (MCAR, MAR and MNAR). Empirically, we thoroughly compare various methods (constant and iterative imputations, complete case analysis, PbP, and an EM algorithm) across classification, probability estimation, calibration, and parameter inference. Our analysis provides a comprehensive view on the logistic regression with missing values. It reveals that mean imputation can be used as baseline for low sample sizes, and improved performance is obtained via nonlinear multiple iterative imputation techniques with the labels (MICE.RF.Y). For large sample sizes, PbP is the best method for Gaussian mixtures, and we recommend MICE.RF.Y in presence of nonlinear features."

Traditionally, methods such as manual counting, loop detectors, pneumatic road tubes, and camera-based recognition have been used for TMC estimation. Although generally reliable, camera-based TMC estimation is prone to inaccuracies under poor lighting conditions during harsh weather and nighttime. In contrast, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology is gaining popularity in recent times due to reduced costs and its expanding use in 3D object detection, tracking, and related applications. This paper presents the authors' endeavor to develop, deploy and evaluate a dual-LiDAR system at an intersection in the city of Rialto, California, for TMC estimation. The 3D bounding box detections from the two LiDARs are used to classify vehicle counts based on traffic directions, vehicle movements, and vehicle classes. This work discusses the estimated TMC results and provides insights into the observed trends and irregularities. Potential improvements are also discussed that could enhance not only TMC estimation, but also trajectory forecasting and intent prediction at intersections."

This leads to the task of finding positive eigenvectors of a certain nonlinear function that maps cost matrices to OT distances. Having this basic idea in mind, we consider both the algorithmic and the modeling part of unsupervised metric learning. First, we examine appropriate algorithms and their convergence. In particular, we propose to use the stochastic random function iteration algorithm and prove that it converges linearly for our setting, although our operators are not paracontractive as it was required for convergence so far. Second, we ask the natural question if the OT distance can be replaced by other distances. We show how Mahalanobis-like distances fit into our considerations. Further, we examine an approach via graph Laplacians. In contrast to the previous settings, we have just to deal with linear functions in the wanted matrices here, so that simple algorithms from linear algebra can be applied."

Tree-structured reasoning methods, particularly the Probabilistic Tree-of-Thought (ProbTree)(Cao et al., 2023) framework, mitigate these issues by decomposing questions into hierarchical structures and selecting answers through confidence-weighted aggregation of parametric and retrieved knowledge (Yao et al., 2023). However, ProbTree's static implementation introduces two key limitations: (1) the reasoning tree is fixed during the initial construction phase, preventing dynamic adaptation to intermediate results, and (2) each node requires exhaustive evaluation of all possible solution strategies, creating computational inefficiency. We present a dynamic reinforcement learning (Sutton and Barto, 2018) framework that transforms tree-based reasoning into an adaptive process. Our approach incrementally constructs the reasoning tree based on real-time confidence estimates, while learning optimal policies for action selection (decomposition, retrieval, or aggregation). This maintains ProbTree's probabilistic rigor while improving both solution quality and computational efficiency through selective expansion and focused resource allocation. The work establishes a new paradigm for treestructured reasoning that balances the reliability of probabilistic frameworks with the flexibility required for real-world question answering systems."

In previous editions of the BraTS Local Synthesis of Healthy Brain Tissue via Inpainting Challenge, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) demonstrated qualitatively convincing results but suffered from low sampling speed. To mitigate this limitation, we adapted a 2D image generation approach, combining DDPMs with generative adversarial networks (GANs) and employing a variance-preserving noise schedule, for the task of 3D inpainting. Our experiments showed that the variance-preserving noise schedule and the selected reconstruction losses can be effectively utilized for high-quality 3D inpainting in a few time steps without requiring adversarial training. We applied our findings to a different architecture, a 3D wavelet diffusion model (WDM3D) that does not include a GAN component. The resulting model, denoted as fastWDM3D, obtained a SSIM of 0.8571, a MSE of 0.0079, and a PSNR of 22.26 on the BraTS inpainting test set. Remarkably, it achieved these scores using only two time steps, completing the 3D inpainting process in 1.81 s per image. When compared to other DDPMs used for healthy brain tissue inpainting, our model is up to 800 x faster while still achieving superior performance metrics. Our proposed method, fastWDM3D, represents a promising approach for fast and accurate healthy tissue inpainting. Our code is available at https://github.com/AliciaDurrer/fastWDM3D."

Our empirical analysis reveals that existing methods for detecting deepfake audio are often vulnerable to anti-forensic (AF) attacks, particularly those attacked using generative adversarial networks. In this article, we propose a novel collaborative learning method called SHIELD to defend against generative AF attacks. To expose AF signatures, we integrate an auxiliary generative model, called the defense (DF) generative model, which facilitates collaborative learning by combining input and output. Furthermore, we design a triplet model to capture correlations for real and AF attacked audios with real-generated and attacked-generated audios using auxiliary generative models. The proposed SHIELD strengthens the defense against generative AF attacks and achieves robust performance across various generative models.

This slicing mechanism incurs unnecessary computational costs due to uninformative directions, which also affects the representative power of the distance. However, finding a more appropriate distribution over the projecting directions (slicing distribution) is often an optimization problem in itself that comes with its own computational cost. In addition, with more intricate distributions, the sampling itself may be expensive. As a remedy, we propose an optimization-free slicing distribution that provides fast sampling for the Monte Carlo approximation. We do so by introducing the Relation-Aware Projecting Direction (RAPD), effectively capturing the pairwise association of each of two pairs of random vectors, each following their ambient law. This enables us to derive the Relation-Aware Slicing Distribution (RASD), a location-scale law corresponding to sampled RAPDs. Finally, we introduce the RASGW distance and its variants, e.g., IWRASGW (Importance Weighted RASGW), which overcome the shortcomings experienced by SGW.

Although more efficient than laboratory-based methods, DFT calculations still entail substantial computational and environmental costs. Machine learning (ML) models have recently gained attention as surrogates for DFT, offering drastic reductions in resource use with competitive predictive performance. In this study, we reproduce a canonical DFT-based workflow to estimate the maximum efficiency limit and progressively replace its components with ML surrogates. By quantifying the CO$_2$ emissions associated with each computational strategy, we evaluate the trade-offs between predictive efficacy and environmental cost. Our results reveal multiple hybrid ML/DFT strategies that optimize different points along the accuracy--emissions front. We find that direct prediction of scalar quantities, such as maximum efficiency, is significantly more tractable than using predicted absorption spectra as an intermediate step. Interestingly, ML models trained on DFT data can outperform DFT workflows using alternative exchange--correlation functionals in screening applications, highlighting the consistency and utility of data-driven approaches. We also assess strategies to improve ML-driven screening through expanded datasets and improved model architectures tailored to PV-relevant features.

In this paper, we focus on two types of gradient noises: one is sub-Weibull noise, and the other is noise under the assumption that it has a bounded $p$-th central moment ($p$-BCM) with $p\\in (1, 2]$. The latter is more challenging due to the occurrence of infinite variance when $p\\in (1, 2)$. Under these two gradient noise assumptions, the in-expectation and high-probability convergence of SFOMs have been extensively studied in the contexts of convex optimization and standard smooth optimization. However, for weakly convex objectives-a class that includes all Lipschitz-continuous convex objectives and smooth objectives-our understanding of the in-expectation and high-probability convergence of SFOMs under these two types of noises remains incomplete. We investigate the high-probability convergence of the vanilla stochastic subgradient descent (SsGD) method under sub-Weibull noises, as well as the high-probability and in-expectation convergence of clipped SsGD under the $p$-BCM noises. Both analyses are conducted in the context of weakly convex optimization. For weakly convex objectives that may be non-convex and non-smooth, our results demonstrate that the theoretical dependence of vanilla SsGD on the failure probability and number of iterations under sub-Weibull noises does not degrade compared to the case of smooth objectives. Under $p$-BCM noises, our findings indicate that the non-smoothness and non-convexity of weakly convex objectives do not impact the theoretical dependence of clipped SGD on the failure probability relative to the smooth case; however, the sample complexity we derived is worse than a well-known lower bound for smooth optimization."

This paper introduces RIDER (RIsk minimization under Dynamically Evolving Regimes) which derives optimally-weighted empirical risk minimization procedures under temporal distribution shifts. Our approach is theoretically grounded in the random distribution shift model, where random shifts arise as a superposition of numerous unpredictable changes in the data-generating process. We show that common weighting schemes, such as pooling all data, exponentially weighting data, and using only the most recent data, emerge naturally as special cases in our framework. We demonstrate that RIDER consistently improves out-of-sample predictive performance when applied as a fine-tuning step on the Yearbook dataset, across a range of benchmark methods in Wild-Time. Moreover, we show that RIDER outperforms standard weighting strategies in two other real-world tasks: predicting stock market volatility and forecasting ride durations in NYC taxi data."

The most common is the use of automated benchmarks in which LLMs have to answer multiple-choice questions of different topics. However, this method has certain limitations, being the most concerning, the poor correlation with the humans. An alternative approach, is to have humans evaluate the LLMs. This poses scalability issues as there is a large and growing number of models to evaluate making it impractical (and costly) to run traditional studies based on recruiting a number of evaluators and having them rank the responses of the models. An alternative approach is the use of public arenas, such as the popular LM arena, on which any user can freely evaluate models on any question and rank the responses of two models. The results are then elaborated into a model ranking. An increasingly important aspect of LLMs is their energy consumption and, therefore, evaluating how energy awareness influences the decisions of humans in selecting a model is of interest. In this paper, we present GEA, the Generative Energy Arena, an arena that incorporates information on the energy consumption of the model in the evaluation process. Preliminary results obtained with GEA are also presented, showing that for most questions, when users are aware of the energy consumption, they favor smaller and more energy efficient models. This suggests that for most user interactions, the extra cost and energy incurred by the more complex and top-performing models do not provide an increase in the perceived quality of the responses that justifies their use."

In this study, we propose a coupled modelling framework with an online social network layer to analyse how engagement on a specific topic spills over into offline protest activities. We develop a stochastic model and derive several mean-field models of varying complexity. These models allow us to estimate the reproductive number and anticipate when surges in activity are likely to occur. A key factor is the transmission rate between the online and offline domains; for offline outbursts to emerge, this rate must fall within a critical range, neither too low nor too high. Additionally, using synthetic networks, we examine how network structure influences the accuracy of these approximations. Our findings indicate that low-density networks need more complex approximations, whereas simpler models can effectively represent higher-density networks. When tested on two real-world networks, however, increased complexity did not enhance accuracy."

Keeping these representations accurate and up-to-date is crucial for seamless interaction and system reliability. In this paper, we propose bidirectional age of incorrect information (BAoII) to address this aspect. BAoII quantifies the time-dependent penalty paid by an entity in a VDE due to incorrect or outdated knowledge about itself and the overall dynamically changing space. This extends the concept of age of incorrect information for a bidirectional information exchange, capturing that a VDE requires mutual awareness of the entity's own representation, measured in the virtual space, and what the other entities share about their representations. Using a continuous-time Markov chain model, we derive a closed-form expression for long-term BAoII and identify a transmission cost threshold for optimal update strategies. We describe a trade-off between communication cost and information freshness and validate our model through numerical simulations, demonstrating the impact of BAoII on evaluating system performance and highlighting its relevance for real-time collaboration in the Metaverse and DTs."

Fusing high-spatial-resolution multispectral images (HR-MSI) with low-spatial-resolution hyperspectral images (LR-HSI) is a promising route to recover fine spatial structures without sacrificing spectral fidelity. Most state-of-the-art methods for HSI-MSI fusion demand point spread function (PSF) calibration or ground truth high resolution HSI (HR-HSI), both of which are impractical to obtain in real world settings. We present SpectraLift, a fully self-supervised framework that fuses LR-HSI and HR-MSI inputs using only the MSI's Spectral Response Function (SRF). SpectraLift trains a lightweight per-pixel multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network using ($i$)~a synthetic low-spatial-resolution multispectral image (LR-MSI) obtained by applying the SRF to the LR-HSI as input, ($ii$)~the LR-HSI as the output, and ($iii$)~an $\\ell_1$ spectral reconstruction loss between the estimated and true LR-HSI as the optimization objective. At inference, SpectraLift uses the trained network to map the HR-MSI pixel-wise into a HR-HSI estimate.

In this work, we aim to reduce data collection efforts when learning visuomotor robot policies by leveraging existing or cost-effective data from a wide range of embodiments, such as public robot datasets and the datasets of humans playing with objects (human data from play). Our approach leverages two key insights. First, we use optic flow as an embodiment-agnostic action representation to train a World Model (WM) across multi-embodiment datasets, and finetune it on a small amount of robot data from the target embodiment. Second, we develop a method, Latent Policy Steering (LPS), to improve the output of a behavior-cloned policy by searching in the latent space of the WM for better action sequences. In real world experiments, we observe significant improvements in the performance of policies trained with a small amount of data (over 50% relative improvement with 30 demonstrations and over 20% relative improvement with 50 demonstrations) by combining the policy with a WM pretrained on two thousand episodes sampled from the existing Open X-embodiment dataset across different robots or a cost-effective human dataset from play."

The main reason is that the trajectory is a kind of complex data, including spatial and temporal information, which is crucial for accurate prediction. Intuitively, the more information the model can capture, the more precise the future trajectory can be predicted. However, previous works based on deep learning methods processed spatial and temporal information separately, leading to inadequate spatial information capture, which means they failed to capture the complete spatial information. Therefore, it is of significance to capture information more fully and effectively on vehicle interactions. In this study, we introduced an integrated 3D graph that incorporates both spatial and temporal edges. Based on this, we proposed the integrated 3D graph, which considers the cross-time interaction information. In specific, we design a Spatial-Temporal Fusion (STF) model including Multi-layer perceptions (MLP) and Graph Attention (GAT) to capture the spatial and temporal information historical trajectories simultaneously on the 3D graph. Our experiment on the ApolloScape Trajectory Datasets shows that the proposed STF outperforms several baseline methods, especially on the long-time-horizon trajectory prediction."

However, these methods often struggle with a knowledge-task disconnect and lack logical consistency in their predictions. To address these issues, we introduce a novel approach named Logically Consistent Chain-of-Thought (LC-CoT) for ZSSD, which improves stance detection by ensuring relevant and logically sound knowledge extraction. LC-CoT employs a three-step process. Initially, it assesses whether supplementary external knowledge is necessary. Subsequently, it uses API calls to retrieve this knowledge, which can be processed by a separate LLM. Finally, a manual exemplar guides the LLM to infer stance categories, using an if-then logical structure to maintain relevance and logical coherence. This structured approach to eliciting background knowledge enhances the model's capability, outperforming traditional supervised methods without relying on labeled data."

The task of automatic author attribution for relatively small chunks of text is an important NLP task but can be challenging. We empirically evaluate the power of 3 open SotA LLMs in zero-shot setting (Gemma-7B, Mixtral 8x7B, and LLaMA-2-13B). We acquired the top 10 most popular books of a month, according to Project Gutenberg, divided each one into equal chunks of 400 words, and prompted each LLM to predict the author. We then randomly sampled 162 chunks per book for human evaluation, based on the error margin of 7% and a confidence level of 95%. The average results show that Mixtral 8x7B has the highest prediction accuracy, the lowest SHI, and a Pearson's correlation (r) of 0.724, 0.263, and -0.9996, respectively, followed by LLaMA-2-13B and Gemma-7B. However, Mixtral 8x7B suffers from high hallucinations for 3 books, rising as high as a SHI of 0.87 (in the range 0-1, where 1 is the worst). The strong negative correlation of accuracy and SHI, given by r, demonstrates the fidelity of the new hallucination metric, which may generalize to other tasks. We also show that prediction accuracies correlate positively with the frequencies of Wikipedia instances of the book titles instead of the downloads and we perform error analyses of predictions.

We show that alternative frameworks focusing directly on relevant populations rather than abstract distributions are available and leave classical learning theory almost unchanged. Furthermore, we argue that the assumption of true probabilities or data-generating distributions can be misleading and obscure both the choices made and the goals pursued in machine learning practice.

E.g., during a company's earnings call, an executive might project a positive revenue outlook to reassure investors, despite uncertainty regarding future earnings. It is crucial for LLMs to incorporate this uncertainty systematically when making decisions. In this paper, we introduce \\textsc{DeFine}, a modular framework that constructs probabilistic factor profiles from complex scenarios. It then integrates these profiles with analogical reasoning, leveraging insights from similar past experiences to guide LLMs in making critical decisions in new situations. Our framework separates the tasks of quantifying uncertainty and incorporating it into LLM decision-making.

However, the success of RMAB crucially relies on the availability and quality of reward signals. Unfortunately, specifying an exact reward function in practice can be challenging and even infeasible. In this paper, we introduce Pref-RMAB, a new RMAB model in the presence of \\textit{preference} signals, where the decision maker only observes pairwise preference feedback rather than scalar reward from the activated arms at each decision epoch. Preference feedback, however, arguably contains less information than the scalar reward, which makes Pref-RMAB seemingly more difficult. To address this challenge, we present a direct online preference learning (DOPL) algorithm for Pref-RMAB to efficiently explore the unknown environments, adaptively collect preference data in an online manner, and directly leverage the preference feedback for decision-makings. We prove that DOPL yields a sublinear regret. To our best knowledge, this is the first algorithm to ensure $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{T\\ln T})$ regret for RMAB with preference feedback.

These models achieve substantial performance improvements at reduced inference costs. However, the deployment of SMoE models faces constraints from extensive memory requirements of expert components in resource-limited environments. To address these limitations, this paper introduces Hierarchical Clustering for Sparsely activated Mixture of Experts (HC-SMoE), a task-agnostic expert merging framework for parameter reduction without retraining. HC-SMoE introduces a novel hierarchical clustering approach based on expert outputs to ensure merging robustness independent of routing decisions. The proposed output-based clustering method enables effective capture of functional relationships between experts for large-scale architectures. We provide theoretical analysis and comprehensive evaluations across multiple zero-shot language tasks to demonstrate HC-SMoE's effectiveness in state-of-the-art models including Qwen and Mixtral. The experimental results validate HC-SMoE's superior performance and practical applicability for real-world deployments."

Naively grouping all tasks or a random set of tasks can result in negative transfer, with the multi-task models performing worse than single-task models. Though many efforts have been made to identify task groupings and to measure the relatedness among different tasks, it remains a challenging research topic to define a metric to identify the best task grouping out of a pool of many potential task combinations. We propose a metric of task relatedness based on task difficulty measured by pointwise V-usable information (PVI). PVI is a recently proposed metric to estimate how much usable information a dataset contains given a model. We hypothesize that tasks with not statistically different PVI estimates are similar enough to benefit from the joint learning process. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the feasibility of this metric for task grouping on 15 NLP datasets in the general, biomedical, and clinical domains. We compare the results of the joint learners against single learners, existing baseline methods, and recent large language models, including Llama 2 and GPT-4. The results show that by grouping tasks with similar PVI estimates, the joint learners yielded competitive results with fewer total parameters, with consistent performance across domains."

Currently, state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction (NWP) models are known to struggle to produce skillful rainfall forecasts in tropical regions of Africa. There is thus a pressing need for improved rainfall forecasting in these regions. Over the last decade or so, the increased availability of large-scale meteorological datasets and the development of powerful machine learning models have opened up new opportunities for data-driven weather forecasting. Focusing on Ghana in this study, we use these tools to develop two U-Net convolutional neural network (CNN) models, to predict 24h rainfall at 12h and 30h lead-time. The models were trained using data from the ERA5 reanalysis dataset, and the GPM-IMERG dataset. A special attention was paid to interpretability. We developed a novel statistical methodology that allowed us to probe the relative importance of the meteorological variables input in our model, offering useful insights into the factors that drive precipitation in the Ghana region. Empirically, we found that our 12h lead-time model has performances that match, and in some accounts are better than the 18h lead-time forecasts produced by the ECMWF (as available in the TIGGE dataset). We also found that combining our data-driven model with classical NWP further improves forecast accuracy."

While extensive research exists, most efforts either focus on specific tasks, i.e., anomalies or normal products only, or require separate models for each anomaly type. Consequently, prior methods either offer limited generative capability or depend on a vast array of anomaly-specific models. We demonstrate that U-Net's differentiated learning ability captures the distinct visual traits of slightly-varied normal products and diverse anomalies, enabling us to construct a unified model for all tasks. Specifically, we first introduce an Unbalanced Abnormal (UA) Text Prompt, comprising one normal token and multiple anomaly tokens. More importantly, our Decoupled Anomaly Alignment (DA) loss decouples anomaly attributes and binds them to distinct anomaly tokens of UA, enabling SeaS to create unseen anomalies by recombining these attributes. Furthermore, our Normal-image Alignment (NA) loss aligns the normal token to normal patterns, making generated normal products globally consistent and locally varied. Finally, SeaS produces accurate anomaly masks by fusing discriminative U-Net features with high-resolution VAE features. SeaS sets a new benchmark for industrial generation, significantly enhancing downstream applications, with average improvements of $+8.66\\%$ pixel-level AP for synthesis-based AD approaches, $+1.10\\%$ image-level AP for unsupervised AD methods, and $+12.79\\%$ IoU for supervised segmentation models.

To address these challenges, we propose SCULPT (Systematic Tuning of Long Prompts), a framework that treats prompt optimization as a hierarchical tree refinement problem. SCULPT represents prompts as tree structures, enabling targeted modifications while preserving contextual integrity. It employs a Critic-Actor framework that generates reflections and applies actions to refine the prompt. Evaluations demonstrate SCULPT's effectiveness on long prompts, its robustness to adversarial perturbations, and its ability to generate high-performing prompts even without any initial human-written prompt. Compared to existing state of the art methods, SCULPT consistently improves LLM performance by preserving essential task information while applying structured refinements. Both qualitative and quantitative analyses show that SCULPT produces more stable and interpretable prompt modifications, ensuring better generalization across tasks."

Most existing LVLM hallucination benchmarks are constrained to evaluate the object-related hallucinations. However, the potential hallucination on the relations between two objects, i.e., relation hallucination, still lacks investigation. To remedy that, we design a unified framework to measure the object and relation hallucination in LVLMs simultaneously. The core idea of our framework is to evaluate hallucinations via (object, relation, object) triplets extracted from LVLMs' responses, making it easily generalizable to different vision-language tasks. Based on our framework, we further introduce Tri-HE, a novel Triplet-level Hallucination Evaluation benchmark which can be used to study both object and relation hallucination at the same time. With comprehensive evaluations on Tri-HE, we observe that the relation hallucination issue is even more serious than object hallucination among existing LVLMs, highlighting a previously neglected problem towards reliable LVLMs. Moreover, based on our findings, we design a simple training-free approach that effectively mitigates hallucinations for LVLMs. Our dataset and code for the reproduction of our experiments are available publicly at https://github.com/wujunjie1998/Tri-HE."

While people observe that some noises are ``golden noises'' that can achieve better text-image alignment and higher human preference than others, we still lack a machine learning framework to obtain those golden noises. To learn golden noises for diffusion sampling, we mainly make three contributions in this paper. First, we identify a new concept termed the \\textit{noise prompt}, which aims at turning a random Gaussian noise into a golden noise by adding a small desirable perturbation derived from the text prompt. Following the concept, we first formulate the \\textit{noise prompt learning} framework that systematically learns ``prompted'' golden noise associated with a text prompt for diffusion models. Second, we design a noise prompt data collection pipeline and collect a large-scale \\textit{noise prompt dataset}~(NPD) that contains 100k pairs of random noises and golden noises with the associated text prompts. With the prepared NPD as the training dataset, we trained a small \\textit{noise prompt network}~(NPNet) that can directly learn to transform a random noise into a golden noise. The learned golden noise perturbation can be considered as a kind of prompt for noise, as it is rich in semantic information and tailored to the given text prompt. Third, our extensive experiments demonstrate the impressive effectiveness and generalization of NPNet on improving the quality of synthesized images across various diffusion models, including SDXL, DreamShaper-xl-v2-turbo, and Hunyuan-DiT. Moreover, NPNet is a small and efficient controller that acts as a plug-and-play module with very limited additional inference and computational costs, as it just provides a golden noise instead of a random noise without accessing the original pipeline."

In this paper, we take a further step and introduce a \\emph{personalized} FedRL framework (PFedRL) by taking advantage of possibly shared common structure among agents in heterogeneous environments. Specifically, we develop a class of PFedRL algorithms named PFedRL-Rep that learns (1) a shared feature representation collaboratively among all agents, and (2) an agent-specific weight vector personalized to its local environment. We analyze the convergence of PFedTD-Rep, a particular instance of the framework with temporal difference (TD) learning and linear representations. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to prove a linear convergence speedup with respect to the number of agents in the PFedRL setting. To achieve this, we show that PFedTD-Rep is an example of the federated two-timescale stochastic approximation with Markovian noise. Experimental results demonstrate that PFedTD-Rep, along with an extension to the control setting based on deep Q-networks (DQN), not only improve learning in heterogeneous settings, but also provide better generalization to new environments."

To address this challenge, we propose a new attention mechanism, named cascaded multi-scale attention (CMSA), tailored for use in CNN-ViT hybrid architectures, to handle low-resolution inputs effectively. The design of CMSA enables the extraction and seamless integration of features across various scales without necessitating the downsampling of the input image or feature maps. This is achieved through a novel combination of grouped multi-head self-attention mechanisms with window-based local attention and cascaded fusion of multi-scale features over different scales. This architecture allows for the effective handling of features across different scales, enhancing the model's ability to perform tasks such as human pose estimation, head pose estimation, and more with low-resolution images. Our experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in these areas with fewer parameters, showcasing its potential for broad application in real-world scenarios where capturing high-resolution images is not feasible.

Previous works often argued that this might be because no classifier exists that is robust and accurate at the same time. However, in computer vision this assumption does not match reality where humans are usually accurate and robust on most tasks of interest. We offer an alternative explanation and show that in certain settings robust generalization is only possible with unrealistically large amounts of data. Specifically, we find a setting where a robust classifier exists, it is easy to learn an accurate classifier, yet it requires an exponential amount of data to learn a robust classifier. Based on this theoretical result, we evaluate the influence of the amount of training data on datasets such as CIFAR-10. Our findings indicate that the amount of training data is the main factor determining the robust performance. Furthermore we show that there are low magnitude directions in the data which are useful for non-robust generalization but are not available for robust classifiers.

Recent efforts have shifted toward training a single model capable of handling multiple classes. However, directly extending early AD methods to multi-class settings often results in degraded performance. In this paper, we investigate this performance degradation observed in reconstruction-based methods, identifying the key issue: inter-class confusion. This confusion emerges when a model trained in multi-class scenarios incorrectly reconstructs samples from one class as those of another, thereby exacerbating reconstruction errors. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective modification, called class-aware contrastive learning (CCL). By explicitly leveraging raw object category information (\\eg carpet or wood) as supervised signals, we introduce local CL to refine multiscale dense features, and global CL to obtain more compact feature representations of normal patterns, thereby effectively adapting the models to multi-class settings. Experiments across five datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating significant improvements and superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

It is especially challenging in poor lighting and with fast motion. This is partly due to limitations of RGB cameras: To capture frames under low lighting, the exposure time needs to be increased, which leads to more motion blur. In contrast, event cameras, which record changes in pixel brightness asynchronously, are much less dependent on lighting, making them more suitable for recording fast motion. We hence propose the first method to spatiotemporally reconstruct a scene from sparse multi-view event streams and sparse RGB frames. We train a sequence of cross-faded time-conditioned NeRF models, one per short recording segment. The individual segments are supervised with a set of event- and RGB-based losses and sparse-view regularisation. We assemble a real-world multi-view camera rig with six static event cameras around the object and record a benchmark multi-view event stream dataset of challenging motions. Our work outperforms RGB-based baselines, producing state-of-the-art results, and opens up the topic of multi-view event-based reconstruction as a new path for fast scene capture beyond RGB cameras.

However, most existing RS image restoration methods focus mainly on conventional first-order degradation models, which may not effectively capture the imaging mechanisms of remote sensing images. Furthermore, many RS image restoration approaches that use deep learning are often criticized for their lacks of architecture transparency and model interpretability. To address these problems, we propose a novel progressive restoration network for high-order degradation imaging (HDI-PRNet), to progressively restore different image degradation. HDI-PRNet is developed based on the theoretical framework of degradation imaging, also Markov properties of the high-order degradation process and Maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation, offering the benefit of mathematical interpretability within the unfolding network. The framework is composed of three main components: a module for image denoising that relies on proximal mapping prior learning, a module for image deblurring that integrates Neumann series expansion with dual-domain degradation learning, and a module for super-resolution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance on both synthetic and real remote sensing images."

However, when building real-world RAG applications, practical issues arise. First, the retrieved information is generally domain-specific. Since it is computationally expensive to fine-tune LLMs, it is more feasible to fine-tune the retriever to improve the quality of the data included in the LLM input. Second, as more applications are deployed in the same real-world system, one cannot afford to deploy separate retrievers. Moreover, these RAG applications normally retrieve different kinds of data. Our solution is to instruction fine-tune a small retriever encoder on a variety of domain-specific tasks to allow us to deploy one encoder that can serve many use cases, thereby achieving low-cost, scalability, and speed. We show how this encoder generalizes to out-of-domain settings as well as to an unseen retrieval task on real-world enterprise use cases."

In such cases, NN generalization can be reduced to a problem of learning more domain-invariant features. Domain adaptation (DA) methods include a range of techniques aimed at achieving this; however, these methods have struggled with the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning, which then incurs significant computational costs. In this work, we introduce SIDDA, an out-of-the-box DA training algorithm built upon the Sinkhorn divergence, that can achieve effective domain alignment with minimal hyperparameter tuning and computational overhead. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on multiple simulated and real datasets of varying complexity, including simple shapes, handwritten digits, and real astronomical observations. SIDDA is compatible with a variety of NN architectures, and it works particularly well in improving classification accuracy and model calibration when paired with equivariant neural networks (ENNs). We find that SIDDA enhances the generalization capabilities of NNs, achieving up to a $\\approx40\\%$ improvement in classification accuracy on unlabeled target data. We also study the efficacy of DA on ENNs with respect to the varying group orders of the dihedral group $D_N$, and find that the model performance improves as the degree of equivariance increases. Finally, we find that SIDDA enhances model calibration on both source and target data--achieving over an order of magnitude improvement in the ECE and Brier score. SIDDA's versatility, combined with its automated approach to domain alignment, has the potential to advance multi-dataset studies by enabling the development of highly generalizable models."

Further, under this SeqKD setting, we also characterize how students behave on specific training data subgroups, such as subgroups with low quality and specific counterfactual memorization (CM) scores, and find that students exhibit amplified denoising on low-quality subgroups. Finally, we propose a modification to SeqKD named Adaptive-SeqKD, which intervenes in SeqKD to reduce memorization and hallucinations. Overall, we recommend caution when applying SeqKD: students inherit both their teachers' superior performance and their fault modes, thereby requiring active monitoring."

PINT incorporates the Simple Harmonic Oscillator Equation as a physics-informed prior, embedding its periodic dynamics into RNN, LSTM, and GRU architectures. This equation's analytical solutions (sine and cosine functions) facilitate rigorous evaluation of the benefits of incorporating physics-informed constraints. By benchmarking against a linear regression baseline derived from its exact solutions, we quantify the impact of embedding physical principles in data-driven models. Unlike traditional time series models that rely on future observations, PINT is designed for practical forecasting. Using only the first 90 days of observed data, it iteratively predicts the next two years, addressing challenges posed by limited real-time updates. Experiments on the WeatherBench dataset demonstrate PINT's ability to generalize, capture periodic trends, and align with physical principles.

Owing to this interpretation, we show that normalized SGD iterates converge to the set of critical points of the normalized margin at late-stage training (i.e., assuming that the data is correctly classified with positive normalized margin). Up to our knowledge, this is the first extension of the analysis of Lyu and Li (2020) on the discrete dynamics of gradient descent to the nonsmooth and stochastic setting.

We define two categories of anomalies: cyber anomalies, which propagate through interconnected variables, and measurement anomalies, which remain localized to individual variables. To address these challenges, we propose the Interpretable Causality Ordinary Differential Equation (ICODE) Networks, a model-intrinsic explainable learning framework. ICODE leverages Neural ODEs for anomaly detection while employing causality inference through an explanation channel to perform root cause analysis (RCA), elucidating why specific time periods are flagged as anomalous. ICODE is designed to simultaneously perform anomaly detection, RCA, and anomaly type classification within a single, interpretable framework. Our approach is grounded in the hypothesis that anomalies alter the underlying ODEs of the system, manifesting as changes in causal relationships between variables. We provide a theoretical analysis of how perturbations in learned model parameters can be utilized to identify anomalies and their root causes in time series data. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of ICODE across various dynamical systems, showcasing its ability to accurately detect anomalies, classify their types, and pinpoint their origins."

However, their relative strengths and weaknesses remain underexplored in the setting where agents must learn from offline trajectories without reward annotations. In this work, we systematically analyze the performance of different RL and control-based methods under datasets of varying quality. On the RL side, we consider goal-conditioned and zero-shot approaches. On the control side, we train a latent dynamics model using the Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) and use it for planning. We study how dataset properties-such as data diversity, trajectory quality, and environment variability-affect the performance of these approaches. Our results show that model-free RL excels when abundant, high-quality data is available, while model-based planning excels in generalization to novel environment layouts, trajectory stitching, and data-efficiency.

Thus, a balance must be struck between removing information and keeping the model's other abilities intact, with a failure to balance this trade-off leading to poor deletion or an unusable model. To this end, we propose UPCORE (Utility-Preserving Coreset Selection), a method-agnostic data selection framework for mitigating collateral damage during unlearning. Finding that the model damage is correlated with the variance of the model's representations on the forget set, we selectively prune the forget set to remove outliers, thereby minimizing model degradation after unlearning. Across three standard unlearning methods, UPCORE consistently achieves a superior balance between the competing objectives of deletion efficacy and model preservation. To better evaluate this trade-off, we introduce a new metric, measuring the area-under-the-curve (AUC) across standard metrics. Our results show that UPCORE improves both standard metrics and AUC, benefiting from positive transfer between the coreset and pruned points while reducing negative transfer from the forget set to points outside of it."

In this paper, we propose Mixing Preference Optimization (MPO), a post-processing framework for aggregating single-objective policies as an alternative to both multi-objective RLHF (MORLHF) and MaxMin-RLHF.

In this paper, we introduce the Attribute-aware Prompt Attack (AP-Attack), a novel method that leverages VLM's image-text alignment capability to explicitly disrupt fine-grained semantic features of pedestrian images by destroying attribute-specific textual embeddings. To obtain personalized textual descriptions for individual attributes, textual inversion networks are designed to map pedestrian images to pseudo tokens that represent semantic embeddings, trained in the contrastive learning manner with images and a predefined prompt template that explicitly describes the pedestrian attributes. Inverted benign and adversarial fine-grained textual semantics facilitate attacker in effectively conducting thorough disruptions, enhancing the transferability of adversarial examples. Extensive experiments show that AP-Attack achieves state-of-the-art transferability, significantly outperforming previous methods by 22.9% on mean Drop Rate in cross-model&amp;dataset attack scenarios."

Currently, mainstream Agent-based methods use external tools to assist a single MLLM in answering long video questions. Despite such tool-based support, a solitary MLLM still offers only a partial understanding of long videos, resulting in limited performance. In order to better address long video tasks, we introduce LVAgent, the first framework enabling multi-round dynamic collaboration of MLLM agents in long video understanding. Our method consists of four key steps: 1) Selection: We pre-select appropriate agents from the model library to form optimal agent teams based on different tasks. 2) Perception: We design an effective retrieval scheme for long videos to improve the coverage of critical temporal segments while maintaining computational efficiency. 3) Action: Agents answer long video questions and exchange reasons. 4) Reflection: We evaluate each agent's performance in each round of discussion and optimize the agent team for dynamic collaboration. The agents iteratively refine their answers by multi-round dynamical collaboration of MLLM agents. LVAgent is the first agent system method that outperforms all closed-source models (like GPT-4o) and open-source models (like InternVL-2.5 and Qwen2-VL) in the long video understanding tasks. Our LVAgent achieves an accuracy of 80\\% on four mainstream long video understanding tasks. Notably, LVAgent improves accuracy by 13.3\\% on LongVideoBench.

To efficiently compress a given graph, graph pooling methods often drop their nodes with attention-based scoring with the task loss. However, this often results in simply removing nodes with lower degrees without consideration of their feature-level relevance to the given task. To fix this problem, we propose a Multi-View Pruning(MVP), a graph pruning method based on a multi-view framework and reconstruction loss. Given a graph, MVP first constructs multiple graphs for different views either by utilizing the predefined modalities or by randomly partitioning the input features, to consider the importance of each node in diverse perspectives. Then, it learns the score for each node by considering both the reconstruction and the task loss. MVP can be incorporated with any hierarchical pooling framework to score the nodes. We validate MVP on multiple benchmark datasets by coupling it with two graph pooling methods, and show that it significantly improves the performance of the base graph pooling method, outperforming all baselines. Further analysis shows that both the encoding of multiple views and the consideration of reconstruction loss are the key to the success of MVP, and that it indeed identifies nodes that are less important according to domain knowledge."

Differentially private (DP) finetuning of large language models (LLMs) as data generator is effective, but is impractical when computation resources are limited. Meanwhile, prompt-based methods such as private evolution depend heavily on the manual prompts, and ineffectively use private information in their iterative data selection process. To overcome these limitations, we propose CTCL (Data Synthesis with ConTrollability and CLustering), a novel framework for generating privacy-preserving synthetic data without extensive prompt engineering or billion-scale LLM finetuning. CTCL pretrains a lightweight 140M conditional generator and a clustering-based topic model on large-scale public data. To further adapt to the private domain, the generator is DP finetuned on private data for fine-grained textual information, while the topic model extracts a DP histogram representing distributional information. The DP generator then samples according to the DP histogram to synthesize a desired number of data examples. Evaluation across five diverse domains demonstrates the effectiveness of our framework, particularly in the strong privacy regime. Systematic ablation validates the design of each framework component and highlights the scalability of our approach."

While large language models (LLMs) hold promise due to their extensive world knowledge and in-context learning capabilities, their effectiveness depends on their knowledge of occupational taxonomies, which remains unclear. In this study, we assess the ability of LLMs to generate precise taxonomic entities from taxonomy, highlighting their limitations, especially for smaller models. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-stage framework consisting of inference, retrieval, and reranking stages, which integrates taxonomy-guided reasoning examples to enhance performance by aligning outputs with taxonomic knowledge.

To address this issue, we argue that the information capacity of embeddings is crucial and propose Dense-to-Sparse Feature Distilled Visual Semantic Embedding (D2S-VSE), which enhances the information capacity of sparse text by leveraging dense text distillation. Specifically, D2S-VSE is a two-stage framework. In the pre-training stage, we align images with dense text to enhance the information capacity of visual semantic embeddings. In the fine-tuning stage, we optimize two tasks simultaneously, distilling dense text embeddings to sparse text embeddings while aligning images and sparse texts, enhancing the information capacity of sparse text embeddings.

Our approach integrates multi-modal data of distinct nature and spatio-temporal resolution, including geographical, mobility, socio-demographic, and traffic information, to construct a privacy-preserving and semantically enriched human travel trajectory dataset. Our framework demonstrates adaptability through domain transfer techniques that ensure transferability across diverse urban contexts, as evidenced in case studies of Los Angeles (LA) and Egypt. The framework employs LLMs for semantic enrichment of trajectory data, enabling comprehensive understanding of mobility patterns. Quantitative evaluation shows that our generated synthetic dataset accurately reproduces mobility patterns observed in empirical data. The practical utility of this foundation model approach is demonstrated through large-scale traffic simulations for LA County, where results align well with observed traffic data.

While proper scoring rules incentivize truthful reporting of precise forecasts, they fall short when forecasters face epistemic uncertainty about their beliefs, limiting their use in safety-critical domains where decision-makers (DMs) prioritize proper uncertainty management. To address this, we propose a framework for scoring imprecise forecasts -- forecasts given as a set of beliefs. Despite existing impossibility results for deterministic scoring rules, we enable truthful elicitation by drawing connection to social choice theory and introducing a two-way communication framework where DMs first share their aggregation rules (e.g., averaging or min-max) used in downstream decisions for resolving forecast ambiguity. This, in turn, helps forecasters resolve indecision during elicitation. We further show that truthful elicitation of imprecise forecasts is achievable using proper scoring rules randomized over the aggregation procedure. Our approach allows DM to elicit and integrate the forecaster's epistemic uncertainty into their decision-making process, thus improving credibility."

While this stabilizes training by providing consistent targets, it introduces a new challenge: the hard update period must be carefully tuned to achieve optimal performance. To address this issue, we propose two gradient-based target update methods: DQN with asymmetric gradient target tracking (AGT2-DQN) and DQN with symmetric gradient target tracking (SGT2-DQN). These methods replace the conventional hard target updates with continuous and structured updates using gradient descent, which effectively eliminates the need for manual tuning. We provide a theoretical analysis proving the convergence of these methods in tabular settings. Additionally, empirical evaluations demonstrate their advantages over standard DQN baselines, which suggest that gradient-based target updates can serve as an effective alternative to conventional target update mechanisms in Q-learning."

However, these approaches face limitations, as frozen LLMs lack tool awareness in VR, leading to performance bottlenecks. While leveraging LLMs for reasoning is widely used in other domains, they are not directly applicable to VR due to limited training data, imperfect tools that introduce errors and reduce data collection efficiency in VR, and challenging in fine-tuning on noisy workflows. To address these challenges, we propose DWIM: i) Discrepancy-aware training Workflow generation, which assesses tool usage and extracts more viable workflows for training; and ii) Instruct-Masking fine-tuning, which guides the model to only clone effective actions, enabling the generation of more practical solutions.

However, these methods often consider only a single type of low-level information, which may lead to suboptimal generalization. Through empirical analysis, we have discovered a key insight: different low-level information often exhibits generalization capabilities for different types of forgeries. Furthermore, we found that simple fusion strategies are insufficient to leverage the detection advantages of each low-level and high-level information for various forgery types. Therefore, we propose the Adaptive Low-level Experts Injection (ALEI) framework. Our approach introduces Lora Experts, enabling the backbone network, which is trained with high-level semantic RGB images, to accept and learn knowledge from different low-level information. We utilize a cross-attention method to adaptively fuse these features at intermediate layers. To prevent the backbone network from losing the modeling capabilities of different low-level features during the later stages of modeling, we developed a Low-level Information Adapter that interacts with the features extracted by the backbone network. Finally, we propose Dynamic Feature Selection, which dynamically selects the most suitable features for detecting the current image to maximize generalization detection capability.

We develop a new mixed-precision PTQ approach, Task-Circuit Quantization (TaCQ), that draws parallels to automated circuit discovery, directly conditioning the quantization process on specific weight circuits -- which we define as sets of weights associated with downstream task performance. These weights are kept as 16-bit weights, while others are quantized, maintaining performance while only adding a marginal memory cost. Specifically, TaCQ contrasts unquantized model weights with a uniformly-quantized model to estimate the expected change in weights due to quantization and uses gradient information to predict the resulting impact on task performance, allowing us to preserve task-specific weights. We compare TaCQ-based quantization to existing mixed-precision quantization methods when conditioning both on general-purpose and task-specific data. Across QA, math reasoning, and text-to-SQL tasks for both Llama-3 and Qwen2.5, we find that TaCQ outperforms baselines using the same calibration data and a lower weight budget, achieving major improvements in the 2 and 3-bit regime. With only 3.1 bits we are able to recover 96% of Llama-3-8B-Instruct's unquantized 16-bit MMLU performance, obtaining a 5.25% absolute improvement over SPQR.

To support the creation of high-quality large-scale video content, a modern pipeline requires a comprehensive understanding of both the raw input materials (e.g., the unedited footage captured by cameras) and the editing components (e.g., visual effects). In video editing scenarios, models must process multiple modalities (e.g., vision, audio, text) with strong background knowledge and handle flexible input lengths (e.g., hour-long raw videos), which poses significant challenges for traditional models. In this report, we introduce Vidi, a family of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) for a wide range of video understand editing scenarios. The first release focuses on temporal retrieval, i.e., identifying the time ranges within the input videos corresponding to a given text query, which plays a critical role in intelligent editing. The model is capable of processing hour-long videos with strong temporal understanding capability, e.g., retrieve time ranges for certain queries. To support a comprehensive evaluation in real-world scenarios, we also present the VUE-TR benchmark, which introduces five key advancements. 1) Video duration: significantly longer than videos of existing temporal retrival datasets, 2) Audio support: includes audio-based queries, 3) Query format: diverse query lengths/formats, 4) Annotation quality: ground-truth time ranges are manually annotated. 5) Evaluation metric: a refined IoU metric to support evaluation over multiple time ranges. Remarkably, Vidi significantly outperforms leading proprietary models, e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini, on the temporal retrieval task, indicating its superiority in video editing scenarios."

Extracting the most pertinent context from such data is critical for exploiting its true potential toward optimal and timely decision-making in patient care. While prior research has explored various methods for clinical text summarization, most prior studies either process all input tokens uniformly or rely on heuristic-based filters, which can overlook nuanced clinical cues and fail to prioritize information critical for decision-making. In this study, we propose Contextual, a novel framework that integrates a Context-Preserving Token Filtering method with a Domain-Specific Knowledge Graph (KG) for contextual augmentation. By preserving context-specific important tokens and enriching them with structured knowledge, ConTextual improves both linguistic coherence and clinical fidelity. Our extensive empirical evaluations on two public benchmark datasets demonstrate that ConTextual consistently outperforms other baselines. Our proposed approach highlights the complementary role of token-level filtering and structured retrieval in enhancing both linguistic and clinical integrity, as well as offering a scalable solution for improving precision in clinical text generation."

Synthetic tabular data generation has emerged as a powerful solution, leveraging generative models to learn underlying data distributions and produce realistic, privacy-preserving samples. Although this area has seen growing attention, most existing surveys focus narrowly on specific methods (e.g., GANs or privacy-enhancing techniques), lacking a unified and comprehensive view that integrates recent advances such as diffusion models and large language models (LLMs).\n  In this survey, we present a structured and in-depth review of synthetic tabular data generation methods. Specifically, the survey is organized into three core components: (1) Background, which covers the overall generation pipeline, including problem definitions, synthetic tabular data generation methods, post processing, and evaluation; (2) Generation Methods, where we categorize existing approaches into traditional generation methods, diffusion model methods, and LLM-based methods, and compare them in terms of architecture, generation quality, and applicability; and (3) Applications and Challenges, which summarizes practical use cases, highlights common datasets, and discusses open challenges such as heterogeneity, data fidelity, and privacy protection.\n  This survey aims to provide researchers and practitioners with a holistic understanding of the field and to highlight key directions for future work in synthetic tabular data generation."

Location-based sentiments further shape these preferences.

Uni-Instruct is motivated by our proposed diffusion expansion theory of the $f$-divergence family. Then we introduce key theories that overcome the intractability issue of the original expanded $f$-divergence, resulting in an equivalent yet tractable loss that effectively trains one-step diffusion models by minimizing the expanded $f$-divergence family. The novel unification introduced by Uni-Instruct not only offers new theoretical contributions that help understand existing approaches from a high-level perspective but also leads to state-of-the-art one-step diffusion generation performances. On the CIFAR10 generation benchmark, Uni-Instruct achieves record-breaking Frechet Inception Distance (FID) values of \\textbf{\\emph{1.46}} for unconditional generation and \\textbf{\\emph{1.38}} for conditional generation.

We then demonstrate that RL-finetuned models, even after exhibiting performance plateaus, can generate correct refinements on persistently failed problems by leveraging natural language feedback in the form of critiques. Building on this insight, we propose Critique-GRPO, an online RL framework that integrates both natural language and numerical feedback for effective policy optimization. Critique-GRPO enables LLMs to learn from initial responses and critique-guided self-refinements simultaneously while maintaining exploration. Additionally, we employ a shaping function to amplify learning from correct, especially unfamiliar, refinements and penalize incorrect ones. Extensive experiments with Qwen2.5-7B-Base, Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Base, and Qwen3-8B demonstrate that Critique-GRPO consistently outperforms supervised learning and RL-based fine-tuning methods across eight challenging mathematical, STEM, and general reasoning tasks, improving average pass@1 scores by approximately 4.4% and 3.8% on Qwen2.5-7B-Base and Qwen3-8B, respectively.

Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) algorithms have been developed to address this issue, among them Population-Based Training (PBT) stands out for its ability to generate hyperparameters schedules instead of fixed configurations. PBT trains a population of agents, each with its own hyperparameters, frequently ranking them and replacing the worst performers with mutations of the best agents. These intermediate selection steps can cause PBT to focus on short-term improvements, leading it to get stuck in local optima and eventually fall behind vanilla Random Search over longer timescales. This paper studies how this greediness issue is connected to the choice of evolution frequency, the rate at which the selection is done. We propose Multiple-Frequencies Population-Based Training (MF-PBT), a novel HPO algorithm that addresses greediness by employing sub-populations, each evolving at distinct frequencies. MF-PBT introduces a migration process to transfer information between sub-populations, with an asymmetric design to balance short and long-term optimization. Extensive experiments on the Brax suite demonstrate that MF-PBT improves sample efficiency and long-term performance, even without actually tuning hyperparameters."

The core technology uses calibrated, tracked pointers to accurately record user input and transform these spatial interactions into standardised annotation formats that are compatible with open-source annotation software.

The proposed concept bridges the gap between human expertise and automated data generation, enabling non-IT experts to contribute to the ML training pipeline and preventing the loss of valuable training samples. Preliminary evaluation results confirm the feasibility of capturing detailed annotation trajectories and demonstrate that integration with CVAT streamlines the workflow for subsequent ML tasks.

A theoretical foundation is established using stochastic differential equations (SDEs), from which a closed-form mapping between any signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the optimal denoising timestep is derived. Moreover, to address distribution mismatch, a mathematical scaling method is introduced to align received semantic features with the training distribution of the GAI. Built on this theoretical foundation, a latent diffusion model (LDM)-based semantic communication framework is proposed that combines a variational autoencoder for semantic features extraction, where a pretrained diffusion model is used for denoising. The proposed system is a training-free framework that supports zero-shot generalization, and achieves superior performance under low-SNR and out-of-distribution conditions, offering a scalable and robust solution for future 6G semantic communication systems. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed semantic communication framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in both pixel-level accuracy and semantic perceptual quality, consistently outperforming baselines across a wide range of SNRs and data distributions without any fine-tuning or post-training."

The dataset includes over six million entries extracted from approximately 200,000 images of handwritten migration records.\n  The data extraction process was automated using a deep learning pipeline that included layout analysis, table detection, cell classification, and handwriting recognition. The complete pipeline was applied to all images, resulting in a structured dataset suitable for research.\n  The dataset can be used to study internal migration, urbanization, and family migration, and the spread of disease in preindustrial Finland.

This hampers real-world applicability in scenarios where current-year labels are unavailable. In addition, uncertainty quantification is often overlooked, which reduces the reliability of such approaches for operational crop monitoring. Inspired by ecophysiological principles of plant growth, we propose a simple, model-agnostic Thermal-Time-based Temporal Sampling (T3S) method that replaces calendar time with thermal time. By subsampling time series in this biologically meaningful way, our method highlights key periods within the growing season while reducing temporal redundancy and noise. We evaluate the T3S on a multi-year Sentinel-2 dataset covering the entirety of Switzerland, which allows us to assess all applied methods on unseen years. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, our approach yields substantial improvements in classification accuracy and, critically, provides well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. Moreover, the T3S method excels in low-data regimes and enables significantly more accurate early-season classification. With just 10% of the training labels, it outperforms the current baseline in both accuracy and uncertainty calibration, and by the end of June, it achieves a performance similar to the full-season baseline model."

Yet, most LLM systems rely on full-context prompting, appending all past turns regardless of their relevance. This leads to unbounded memory growth, increased computational costs, and degraded reasoning performance on out-of-distribution input lengths. We introduce MEM1, an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that enables agents to operate with constant memory across long multi-turn tasks. At each turn, MEM1 updates a compact shared internal state that jointly supports memory consolidation and reasoning. This state integrates prior memory with new observations from the environment while strategically discarding irrelevant or redundant information. To support training in more realistic and compositional settings, we propose a simple yet effective and scalable approach to constructing multi-turn environments by composing existing datasets into arbitrarily complex task sequences. Experiments across three domains, including internal retrieval QA, open-domain web QA, and multi-turn web shopping, show that MEM1-7B improves performance by 3.5x while reducing memory usage by 3.7x compared to Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct on a 16-objective multi-hop QA task, and generalizes beyond the training horizon.

Current leading FGIR solutions typically follow two regimes: enforce pairwise similarity constraints in the semantic embedding space, or incorporate a localization sub-network to fine-tune the entire model. However, such two regimes tend to overfit the training data while forgetting the knowledge gained from large-scale pre-training, thus reducing their generalization ability. In this paper, we propose a Dual-Vision Adaptation (DVA) approach for FGIR, which guides the frozen pre-trained model to perform FGIR through collaborative sample and feature adaptation. Specifically, we design Object-Perceptual Adaptation, which modifies input samples to help the pre-trained model perceive critical objects and elements within objects that are helpful for category prediction. Meanwhile, we propose In-Context Adaptation, which introduces a small set of parameters for feature adaptation without modifying the pre-trained parameters. This makes the FGIR task using these adjusted features closer to the task solved during the pre-training. Additionally, to balance retrieval efficiency and performance, we propose Discrimination Perception Transfer to transfer the discriminative knowledge in the object-perceptual adaptation to the image encoder using the knowledge distillation mechanism. Extensive experiments show that DVA has fewer learnable parameters and performs well on three in-distribution and three out-of-distribution fine-grained datasets."

To bridge this gap, we conduct a systematic empirical evaluation. We begin with a pilot experiment, revealing that CoT reasoning significantly affects the LLM's internal states and token probability distributions. Building on this, we evaluate the impact of various CoT prompting methods on mainstream hallucination detection methods across both instruction-tuned and reasoning-oriented LLMs. Specifically, we examine three key dimensions: changes in hallucination score distributions, variations in detection accuracy, and shifts in detection confidence. Our findings show that while CoT prompting helps reduce hallucination frequency, it also tends to obscure critical signals used for detection, impairing the effectiveness of various detection methods.

Existing methods for fetal MRI analysis mainly rely on anatomical keypoints or volumetric body segmentations. Keypoints simplify body structure to facilitate motion analysis, but may ignore important details of full-body shape. Body segmentations capture complete shape information but complicate temporal analysis due to large non-local fetal movements. To address these limitations, we construct a 3D articulated statistical fetal body model based on the Skinned Multi-Person Linear Model (SMPL). Our algorithm iteratively estimates body pose in the image space and body shape in the canonical pose space. This approach improves robustness to MRI motion artifacts and intensity distortions, and reduces the impact of incomplete surface observations due to challenging fetal poses. We train our model on segmentations and keypoints derived from $19,816$ MRI volumes across $53$ subjects. Our model captures body shape and motion across time series and provides intuitive visualization. Furthermore, it enables automated anthropometric measurements traditionally difficult to obtain from segmentations and keypoints. When tested on unseen fetal body shapes, our method yields a surface alignment error of $3.2$ mm for $3$ mm MRI voxel size. To our knowledge, this represents the first 3D articulated statistical fetal body model, paving the way for enhanced fetal motion and shape analysis in prenatal diagnostics.

In contrast to iterative attacks, these methods deliver superior inference-time efficiency, scalability, and transferability; however, up until now, existing studies have not fully exploited the representational capacity of generative models to preserve and harness semantic information. Specifically, the intermediate activations of the generator encode rich semantic features--object boundaries and coarse shapes--that remain under-exploited, thereby limiting the alignment of perturbations with object-salient regions which are critical for adversarial transferability. To remedy this, we introduce a semantic structure-aware attack framework based on the Mean Teacher, which serves as a temporally smoothed feature reference. With this smoothed reference, we further direct semantic consistency between the early-layer activations in the student and those of the semantically rich teacher by feature distillation. By anchoring perturbation synthesis to the semantically salient early intermediate blocks within the generator based on empirical findings, our method guides progressive adversarial perturbation on regions that substantially enhance adversarial transferability. We conduct extensive experiments over diverse models, domains and tasks to demonstrate consistent improvements relative to state-of-the-art generative attacks, comprehensively evaluated using conventional metrics and our newly proposed Accidental Correction Rate (ACR)."

To address these issues, we introduce ZIP, a scalable crowd counting framework that models blockwise counts with a Zero-Inflated Poisson likelihood: a zero-inflation term learns the probability a block is structurally empty (handling excess zeros), while the Poisson component captures expected counts when people are present (respecting discreteness). We provide a generalization analysis showing a tighter risk bound for ZIP than MSE-based losses and DMCount provided that the training resolution is moderately large.

Specifically, we construct a dataset of approximately 2,000 data entries to train the LLMs to perform version migration based on updated information.

Our experiments demonstrate that ReCode substantially boosts LLMs' code generation performance in dynamic API scenarios, especially on the unseen CodeUpdateArena task. Crucially, compared to supervised fine-tuning, ReCode has less impact on LLMs' general code generation abilities. We apply ReCode on various LLMs and reinforcement learning algorithms (GRPO and DAPO), all achieving consistent improvements.

Yet an emerging hypothesis - the Platonic Representation Hypothesis - suggests that such models may nonetheless converge toward a shared statistical model of reality. This compatibility, if it exists, raises a fundamental question: can we move beyond post-hoc statistical detection of alignment and explicitly optimize for it between such disjoint representations? We cast this Platonic alignment problem as a multi-objective optimization task - preserve each modality's native structure while aligning for mutual coherence. We introduce the Joint Autoencoder Modulator (JAM) framework that jointly trains modality-specific autoencoders on the latent representations of pre-trained single modality models, encouraging alignment through both reconstruction and cross-modal objectives. By analogy, this framework serves as a method to escape Plato's Cave, enabling the emergence of shared structure from disjoint inputs. We evaluate this framework across three critical design axes: (i) the alignment objective - comparing contrastive loss (Con), its hard-negative variant (NegCon), and our Spread loss, (ii) the layer depth at which alignment is most effective, and (iii) the impact of foundation model scale on representational convergence. Our findings show that our lightweight Pareto-efficient framework reliably induces alignment, even across frozen, independently trained representations, offering both theoretical insight and practical pathways for transforming generalist unimodal foundations into specialist multimodal models."

        "summary": "arXiv:2507.03331v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: To alleviate the reliance of deep neural networks on large-scale datasets, dataset distillation aims to generate compact, high-quality synthetic datasets that can achieve comparable performance to the original dataset. The integration of generative models has significantly advanced this field. However, existing approaches primarily focus on aligning the distilled dataset with the original one, often overlooking task-specific information that can be critical for optimal downstream performance. In this paper, focusing on the downstream task of classification, we propose a task-specific sampling strategy for generative dataset distillation that incorporates the concept of difficulty to consider the requirements of the target task better. The final dataset is sampled from a larger image pool with a sampling distribution obtained by matching the difficulty distribution of the original dataset. A logarithmic transformation is applied as a pre-processing step to correct for distributional bias. The results of extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and suggest its potential for enhancing performance on other downstream tasks.

It allows for studying sequences from their generating functions, with many operations that can be equivalently defined on the original sequence and its $z$-transform. In particular, the z-transform method focuses on asymptotic behaviors and allows the use of Taylor expansions. We present a sequence of results of increasing significance and difficulty for linear models and optimization algorithms, demonstrating the effectiveness and versatility of the z-transform method in deriving new asymptotic results. Starting from the simplest gradient descent iterations in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, we show how the spectral dimension characterizes the convergence behavior. We then extend the analysis to Nesterov acceleration, averaging techniques, and stochastic gradient descent."

We therefore propose PhenoBench: A comprehensive benchmark for cell phenotyping on Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) stained histopathology images. We provide both PhenoCell, a new H&amp;E dataset featuring 14 granular cell types identified by using multiplexed imaging, and ready-to-use fine-tuning and benchmarking code that allows the systematic evaluation of multiple prominent pathology FMs in terms of dense cell phenotype predictions in different generalization scenarios. We perform extensive benchmarking of existing FMs, providing insights into their generalization behavior under technical vs. medical domain shifts. Furthermore, while FMs achieve macro F1 scores > 0.70 on previously established benchmarks such as Lizard and PanNuke, on PhenoCell, we observe scores as low as 0.20. This indicates a much more challenging task not captured by previous benchmarks, establishing PhenoCell as a prime asset for future benchmarking of FMs and supervised models alike. Code and data are available on GitHub."

        "summary": "arXiv:2507.03580v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: In real world translation scenarios, terminology is rarely one-to-one. Instead, multiple valid translations may appear in a terminology dictionary, but correctness of a translation depends on corporate style guides and context. This can be challenging for neural machine translation (NMT) systems. Luckily, in a corporate context, many examples of human post-edits of valid but incorrect terminology exist. The goal of this work is to learn how to disambiguate our terminology based on these corrections. Our approach is based on preference optimization, using the term post-edit as the knowledge to be preferred. While previous work had to rely on unambiguous translation dictionaries to set hard constraints during decoding, or to add soft constraints in the input, our framework requires neither one-to-one dictionaries nor human intervention at decoding time. We report results on English-German post-edited data and find that the optimal combination of supervised fine-tuning and preference optimization, with both term-specific and full sequence objectives, yields statistically significant improvements in term accuracy over a strong NMT baseline without significant losses in COMET score. Additionally, we release test sets from our post-edited data and terminology dictionary."

However, existing methods are limited to challenging image-based forecasting, which suffers from redundant information and lacks comprehensive and critical world knowledge, including dynamic, spatial and semantic information. To address these limitations, we propose DreamVLA, a novel VLA framework that integrates comprehensive world knowledge forecasting to enable inverse dynamics modeling, thereby establishing a perception-prediction-action loop for manipulation tasks. Specifically, DreamVLA introduces a dynamic-region-guided world knowledge prediction, integrated with the spatial and semantic cues, which provide compact yet comprehensive representations for action planning. This design aligns with how humans interact with the world by first forming abstract multimodal reasoning chains before acting. To mitigate interference among the dynamic, spatial and semantic information during training, we adopt a block-wise structured attention mechanism that masks their mutual attention, preventing information leakage and keeping each representation clean and disentangled. Moreover, to model the conditional distribution over future actions, we employ a diffusion-based transformer that disentangles action representations from shared latent features. Extensive experiments on both real-world and simulation environments demonstrate that DreamVLA achieves 76.7% success rate on real robot tasks and 4.44 average length on the CALVIN ABC-D benchmarks."

Gemini 2.5 Pro is our most capable model yet, achieving SoTA performance on frontier coding and reasoning benchmarks. In addition to its incredible coding and reasoning skills, Gemini 2.5 Pro is a thinking model that excels at multimodal understanding and it is now able to process up to 3 hours of video content. Its unique combination of long context, multimodal and reasoning capabilities can be combined to unlock new agentic workflows. Gemini 2.5 Flash provides excellent reasoning abilities at a fraction of the compute and latency requirements and Gemini 2.0 Flash and Flash-Lite provide high performance at low latency and cost.

This paper investigates the response robustness of LLMs in normative survey contexts - we test nine diverse LLMs on questions from the World Values Survey (WVS), applying a comprehensive set of 11 perturbations to both question phrasing and answer option structure, resulting in over 167,000 simulated interviews. In doing so, we not only reveal LLMs' vulnerabilities to perturbations but also show that all tested models exhibit a consistent recency bias varying in intensity, disproportionately favoring the last-presented answer option. While larger models are generally more robust, all models remain sensitive to semantic variations like paraphrasing and to combined perturbations. By applying a set of perturbations, we reveal that LLMs partially align with survey response biases identified in humans. This underscores the critical importance of prompt design and robustness testing when using LLMs to generate synthetic survey data."

RLLMs enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through Long Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) processes, significantly improving the performance of LLMs in addressing complex problems. However, there are few works that systematically explore what methods can fully unlock the performance of LLMs and RLLMs within the financial domain. To investigate the impact of various methods on LLMs and RLLMs, we utilize five LLMs and three RLLMs to assess the effects of prompting methods, agentic frameworks, and multilingual alignment methods on financial question-answering tasks. Our research findings indicate: (1) Current prompting methods and agent frameworks enhance the performance of LLMs in financial question answering by simulating Long CoT; (2) RLLMs possess inherent Long CoT capabilities, which limits the effectiveness of conventional methods in further enhancing their performance; (3) Current advanced multilingual alignment methods primarily improve the multilingual performance of LLMs by extending the reasoning length, which yields minimal benefits for RLLMs. We hope that this study can serve as an important reference for LLMs and RLLMs in the field of financial question answering."

While recent LLM-powered guardrail approaches such as LlamaGuard achieve high detection accuracy of unsafe inputs written in English (e.g., ``How to create a bomb?''), they struggle with multilingual unsafe inputs. This limitation leaves LLM systems vulnerable to unsafe and jailbreak prompts written in low-resource languages such as those in Southeast Asia. This paper introduces SEALGuard, a multilingual guardrail designed to improve the safety alignment across diverse languages. It aims to address the multilingual safety alignment gap of existing guardrails and ensure effective filtering of unsafe and jailbreak prompts in LLM-powered systems. We adapt a general-purpose multilingual language model into a multilingual guardrail using low-rank adaptation (LoRA). We construct SEALSBench, a large-scale multilingual safety alignment dataset containing over 260,000 prompts in ten languages, including safe, unsafe, and jailbreak cases. We evaluate SEALGuard against state-of-the-art guardrails such as LlamaGuard on this benchmark. Our findings show that multilingual unsafe and jailbreak prompts substantially degrade the performance of the state-of-the-art LlamaGuard, which experiences a drop in Defense Success Rate (DSR) by 9% and 18%, respectively, compared to its performance on English-only prompts. In contrast, SEALGuard outperforms existing guardrails in detecting multilingual unsafe and jailbreak prompts, improving DSR by 48% over LlamaGuard and achieving the best DSR, precision, and F1-score. Our ablation study further reveals the contributions of adaptation strategies and model size to the overall performance of SEALGuard. We release our pre-trained model and benchmark at https://github.com/awsm-research/SEALGuard to support further research."

However, previous research has not adequately understood the semantics of images, and models struggle to discern news authenticity with limited textual information. Meanwhile, treating all emotional types of news uniformly without tailored approaches further leads to performance degradation. Therefore, we propose a novel Knowledge Augmentation and Emotion Guidance Network (KEN). On the one hand, we effectively leverage LVLM's powerful semantic understanding and extensive world knowledge. For images, the generated captions provide a comprehensive understanding of image content and scenes, while for text, the retrieved evidence helps break the information silos caused by the closed and limited text and context. On the other hand, we consider inter-class differences between different emotional types of news through balanced learning, achieving fine-grained modeling of the relationship between emotional types and authenticity. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our KEN."

To overcome this challenge, we push beyond the electron dose limits of conventional electron microscopy by adapting principles from multi-image super-resolution (MISR) that have been widely used in remote sensing. Our method fuses multiple low-resolution, sub-pixel-shifted views and enhances the reconstruction with a convolutional neural network (CNN) that integrates features from synthetic, multi-angle observations. We developed a dual-path, attention-guided network for 4D-STEM that achieves atomic-scale super-resolution from ultra-low-dose data. This provides robust atomic-scale visualization across amorphous, semi-crystalline, and crystalline beam-sensitive specimens. Systematic evaluations on representative materials demonstrate comparable spatial resolution to conventional ptychography under ultra-low-dose conditions. Our work expands the capabilities of 4D-STEM, offering a new and generalizable method for the structural analysis of radiation-vulnerable materials."

This work revisits the inductive biases in Geographically Neural Network Weighted Regression (GNNWR) and identifies limitations in current approaches for modeling spatial non-stationarity. While GNNWR extends traditional Geographically Weighted Regression by using neural networks to learn spatial weighting functions, existing implementations are often restricted by fixed distance-based schemes and limited inductive bias. We propose to generalize GNNWR by incorporating concepts from convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and transformers, introducing local receptive fields, sequential context, and self-attention into spatial regression. Through extensive benchmarking on synthetic spatial datasets with varying heterogeneity, noise, and sample sizes, we show that GNNWR outperforms classic methods in capturing nonlinear and complex spatial relationships. Our results also reveal that model performance depends strongly on data characteristics, with local models excelling in highly heterogeneous or small-sample scenarios, and global models performing better with larger, more homogeneous data. These findings highlight the importance of inductive bias in spatial modeling and suggest future directions, including learnable spatial weighting functions, hybrid neural architectures, and improved interpretability for models handling non-stationary spatial data."

This stitching process is performed by training a connector module that aims to align the representation spaces of these uni-modal models towards a multi-modal objective. However, given the complexity of training such connectors on large scale web-based datasets coupled with the ever-increasing number of available pretrained uni-modal models, the task of uni-modal models selection and subsequent connector module training becomes computationally demanding. To address this under-studied critical problem, we propose Hypernetwork Model Alignment (Hyma), a novel all-in-one solution for optimal uni-modal model selection and connector training by leveraging hypernetworks. Specifically, our framework utilizes the parameter prediction capability of a hypernetwork to obtain jointly trained connector modules for $N \\times M$ combinations of uni-modal models. In our experiments, Hyma reduces the cost of searching for the best performing uni-modal model pair by $10\\times$, while matching the ranking and trained connector performance obtained via grid search across a suite of diverse multi-modal benchmarks."

In contrast, the Target Polish approach remains compatible with the Fast-HALS algorithm, which is renowned for its speed, by adaptively smoothing the data with a weighted median-based transformation. This innovation provides outlier resistance while maintaining the highly efficient additive update structure of Fast-HALS. Empirical evaluations using image datasets corrupted with structured (block) and unstructured (salt) noise demonstrate that the Target Polish approach matches or exceeds the accuracy of state-of-the-art robust NMF methods and reduces computational time by an order of magnitude in the studied scenarios."

Our method simultaneously addresses temperature scaling and manifold approximation by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the predicted Gaussian distributions and a unit isotropic Gaussian. This unifies uncertainty calibration and latent control in a principled probabilistic manner, enabling a natural interpretation of class confidence and geometric consistency. Experiments on CIFAR-10 show that ZClassifier improves over softmax classifiers in robustness, calibration, and latent separation."

Learning a scene representation for multiple modalities enhances comprehension of the physical world. However, modality conflicts, arising from inherent distinctions among different modalities, present two critical challenges: property disparity and granularity disparity. To address these challenges, we propose a general framework, MMOne, to represent multiple modalities in one scene, which can be readily extended to additional modalities. Specifically, a modality modeling module with a novel modality indicator is proposed to capture the unique properties of each modality. Additionally, we design a multimodal decomposition mechanism to separate multi-modal Gaussians into single-modal Gaussians based on modality differences. We address the essential distinctions among modalities by disentangling multimodal information into shared and modality-specific components, resulting in a more compact and efficient multimodal scene representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently enhances the representation capability for each modality and is scalable to additional modalities.

Recently, a machine learning approach known as physics-informed neural network, which solves PDEs using neural networks by minimizing the sum of residuals from the PDEs, BCs, and data, has gained significant attention in the scientific community. In this study, we investigate a physics-informed linear model (PILM) that uses linear combinations of basis functions to represent solutions, thereby enabling an analytical representation of optimal solutions. The PILM was formulated and verified for illustrative forward and inverse problems including cases with uncertain BCs. Furthermore, the PILM was applied to estimate crustal strain rates using geodetic data. Specifically, physical regularization that enforces elastic equilibrium on the velocity fields was compared with mathematical regularization that imposes smoothness constraints. From a Bayesian perspective, mathematical regularization exhibited superior performance. The PILM provides an analytically solvable framework applicable to linear forward and inverse problems, underdetermined systems, and physical regularization."

Defined by oxygen dependence at 36 weeks postmenstrual age, it causes lifelong respiratory complications. However, preventive interventions carry severe risks, including neurodevelopmental impairment, ventilator-induced lung injury, and systemic complications. Therefore, early BPD prognosis and prediction of BPD outcome is crucial to avoid unnecessary toxicity in low risk infants. Admission radiographs of extremely preterm infants are routinely acquired within 24h of life and could serve as a non-invasive prognostic tool. In this work, we developed and investigated a deep learning approach using chest X-rays from 163 extremely low-birth-weight infants ($\\leq$32 weeks gestation, 401-999g) obtained within 24 hours of birth. We fine-tuned a ResNet-50 pretrained specifically on adult chest radiographs, employing progressive layer freezing with discriminative learning rates to prevent overfitting and evaluated a CutMix augmentation and linear probing. For moderate/severe BPD outcome prediction, our best performing model with progressive freezing, linear probing and CutMix achieved an AUROC of 0.78 $\\pm$ 0.10, balanced accuracy of 0.69 $\\pm$ 0.10, and an F1-score of 0.67 $\\pm$ 0.11. In-domain pre-training significantly outperformed ImageNet initialization (p = 0.031) which confirms domain-specific pretraining to be important for BPD outcome prediction. Routine IRDS grades showed limited prognostic value (AUROC 0.57 $\\pm$ 0.11), confirming the need of learned markers. Our approach demonstrates that domain-specific pretraining enables accurate BPD prediction from routine day-1 radiographs. Through progressive freezing and linear probing, the method remains computationally feasible for site-level implementation and future federated learning deployments."

This paper investigates the representation used to condition diffusion models from the perspective that ideal representations should improve sample fidelity, be easy to generate, and be compositional to allow out-of-training samples generation. We introduce Discrete Latent Code (DLC), an image representation derived from Simplicial Embeddings trained with a self-supervised learning objective. DLCs are sequences of discrete tokens, as opposed to the standard continuous image embeddings. They are easy to generate and their compositionality enables sampling of novel images beyond the training distribution. Diffusion models trained with DLCs have improved generation fidelity, establishing a new state-of-the-art for unconditional image generation on ImageNet. Additionally, we show that composing DLCs allows the image generator to produce out-of-distribution samples that coherently combine the semantics of images in diverse ways. Finally, we showcase how DLCs can enable text-to-image generation by leveraging large-scale pretrained language models. We efficiently finetune a text diffusion language model to generate DLCs that produce novel samples outside of the image generator training distribution."

As an initial attempt to address this challenge, we propose \\textbf{PhysX}, an end-to-end paradigm for physical-grounded 3D asset generation. 1) To bridge the critical gap in physics-annotated 3D datasets, we present PhysXNet - the first physics-grounded 3D dataset systematically annotated across five foundational dimensions: absolute scale, material, affordance, kinematics, and function description. In particular, we devise a scalable human-in-the-loop annotation pipeline based on vision-language models, which enables efficient creation of physics-first assets from raw 3D assets.2) Furthermore, we propose \\textbf{PhysXGen}, a feed-forward framework for physics-grounded image-to-3D asset generation, injecting physical knowledge into the pre-trained 3D structural space. Specifically, PhysXGen employs a dual-branch architecture to explicitly model the latent correlations between 3D structures and physical properties, thereby producing 3D assets with plausible physical predictions while preserving the native geometry quality. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance and promising generalization capability of our framework.

Through classical simulations, we demonstrate that our approach effectively finds optimal parameters, hyperparameters and architectural choices with high probability on classification problems including a two-dimensional Gaussian dataset and a scaled-down version of the MNIST handwritten digits.

These requirements push prevalent software architectures to the limit when deploying ML-based systems. Data-oriented Architecture (DOA) is an emerging style that equips systems better for integrating ML models. Even though papers on deployed ML systems do not mention DOA, their authors made design decisions that implicitly follow DOA. Implicit decisions create a knowledge gap, limiting the practitioners' ability to implement ML-based systems. \\hlb{This paper surveys why, how, and to what extent practitioners have adopted DOA to implement and deploy ML-based systems.} We overcome the knowledge gap by answering these questions and explicitly showing the design decisions and practices behind these systems. The survey follows a well-known systematic and semi-automated methodology for reviewing papers in software engineering. The majority of reviewed works partially adopt DOA. Such an adoption enables systems to address requirements such as Big Data management, low latency processing, resource management, security and privacy.

In this work we investigate prediction sets for regression scenarios when the response variable, denoted by $Y$, resides in a manifold, and the covariable, denoted by $X$, lies in an Euclidean space. This extends the concepts delineated in \\cite{waser14} to this novel context. Aligning with traditional principles in conformal inference, these prediction sets are distribution-free, indicating that no specific assumptions are imposed on the joint distribution of $(X,Y)$, and they maintain a non-parametric character.

The lens blur field is a multilayer perceptron (MLP) designed to (1) accurately capture variations of the lens 2D point spread function over image plane location, focus setting and, optionally, depth and (2) represent these variations parametrically as a single, sensor-specific function. The representation models the combined effects of defocus, diffraction, aberration, and accounts for sensor features such as pixel color filters and pixel-specific micro-lenses. To learn the real-world blur field of a given device, we formulate a generalized non-blind deconvolution problem that directly optimizes the MLP weights using a small set of focal stacks as the only input. We also provide a first-of-its-kind dataset of 5D blur fields$-$for smartphone cameras, camera bodies equipped with a variety of lenses, etc. Lastly, we show that acquired 5D blur fields are expressive and accurate enough to reveal, for the first time, differences in optical behavior of smartphone devices of the same make and model.

The worst-class error is important in many applications. For example, in a medical image classification task, it would not be acceptable for the malignant tumor class to have a 40% error rate, while the benign and healthy classes have a 10% error rates. To avoid overfitting in worst-class error minimization using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), we design a problem formulation for bounding the worst-class error instead of achieving zero worst-class error. Moreover, to correctly bound the worst-class error, we propose a boosting approach which ensembles DNNs. We give training and generalization worst-class-error bound. Experimental results show that the algorithm lowers worst-class test error rates while avoiding overfitting to the training set.

This paper illustrates the entire workflow for building the MedPix 2.0 data set. Starting with the well-known multimodal data set MedPix\\textsuperscript{\\textregistered}, mainly used by physicians, nurses, and healthcare students for Continuing Medical Education purposes, a semi-automatic pipeline was developed to extract visual and textual data followed by a manual curing procedure in which noisy samples were removed, thus creating a MongoDB database. Along with the data set, we developed a Graphical User Interface aimed at navigating efficiently the MongoDB instance and obtaining the raw data that can be easily used for training and/or fine-tuning VLMs. To enforce this point, in this work, we first recall DR-Minerva, a Retrieve Augmented Generation-based VLM model trained upon MedPix 2.0. DR-Minerva predicts the body part and the modality used to scan its input image. We also propose the extension of DR-Minerva with a Knowledge Graph that uses Llama 3.1 Instruct 8B, and leverages MedPix 2.0. The resulting architecture can be queried in a end-to-end manner, as a medical decision support system. MedPix 2.0 is available on GitHub."

In this framework, observations are thought to be drawn from a distribution over variables of interest, and the goal is to identify parameters of this distribution. Even though the stated goal is often to inform decision making on some target population, there is no straightforward way to include these target populations in the framework. Instead of modelling the relationship between the observed sample and the target population, the inductive assumptions in this framework take the form of abstract sampling and independence assumptions. In this paper, we develop a version of this framework that construes causal inference as treatment-wise predictions for finite populations where all assumptions are testable in retrospect; this means that one can not only test predictions themselves (without any fundamental problem) but also investigate sources of error when they fail. Due to close connections to the original framework, established methods can still be be analysed under the new framework."

Conventional downscaling methods for generating these data based on numerical weather prediction have a high computational burden and require extensive tuning for historical accuracy. In this work, we present a novel deep learning-based spatiotemporal downscaling method using generative adversarial networks (GANs) for generating historically accurate high-resolution wind resource data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting Reanalysis version 5 data (ERA5). In contrast to previous approaches, which used coarsened high-resolution data as low-resolution training data, we use true low-resolution simulation outputs. We show that by training a GAN model with ERA5 as the low-resolution input and Wind Integration National Dataset Toolkit (WTK) data as the high-resolution target, we achieved results comparable in historical accuracy and spatiotemporal variability to conventional dynamical downscaling. This GAN-based downscaling method additionally reduces computational costs over dynamical downscaling by two orders of magnitude. We applied this approach to downscale 30 km, hourly ERA5 data to 2 km, 5 min wind data for January 2000 through December 2023 at multiple hub heights over Ukraine, Moldova, and part of Romania. This 24-year data record is the first member of the super-resolution for renewable energy resource data with wind from the reanalysis data dataset (Sup3rWind)."

Furthermore, QLSTM exhibits improved predictive accuracy as the number of qubits increases, and faster convergence than classical LSTM under the same training conditions. Notably, QLSTM maintains strong robustness against quantum computer noise, outperforming noise-free classical LSTM in certain settings.

However, since different apps may implement the same functionality in different ways, direct mapping may result in incomplete or buggy test cases, thus significantly impacting the effectiveness of testing target functionality and the practical applicability of migration approaches.\n  In this paper, we propose a new migration paradigm (i.e., the abstraction-concretization paradigm) that first abstracts the test logic for the target functionality and then utilizes this logic to generate the concrete GUI test case. Furthermore, we introduce MACdroid, the first approach that migrates GUI test cases based on this paradigm. Specifically, we propose an abstraction technique that utilizes source test cases from source apps targeting the same functionality to extract a general test logic for that functionality. Then, we propose a concretization technique that utilizes the general test logic to guide an LLM in generating the corresponding GUI test case (including events and assertions) for the target app. We evaluate MACdroid on two widely-used datasets (including 31 apps, 34 functionalities, and 123 test cases). On the FrUITeR dataset, the test cases generated by MACdroid successfully test 64% of the target functionalities, improving the baselines by 191%. On the Lin dataset, MACdroid successfully tests 75% of the target functionalities, outperforming the baselines by 42%. These results underscore the effectiveness of MACdroid in GUI test migration."

However, existing feature selection methods either (i) rely on parametric methods such as linear or generalized linear models, (ii) lack theoretical false discovery control, or (iii) identify few true positives. Here, we introduce a general feature selection method with finite-sample false discovery control based on applying integrated path stability selection (IPSS) to arbitrary feature importance scores. The method is nonparametric whenever the importance scores are nonparametric, and it estimates q-values, which are better suited to high-dimensional data than p-values. We focus on two special cases using importance scores from gradient boosting (IPSSGB) and random forests (IPSSRF). Extensive nonlinear simulations with RNA sequencing data show that both methods accurately control the false discovery rate and detect more true positives than existing methods. Both methods are also efficient, running in under 20 seconds when there are 500 samples and 5000 features. We apply IPSSGB and IPSSRF to detect microRNAs and genes related to cancer, finding that they yield better predictions with fewer features than existing approaches."

We propose an efficient algorithm for solving large-scale MSSC instances, which combines column generation (CG) with dynamic constraint aggregation (DCA) to effectively reduce the number of constraints considered in the CG master problem. DCA was originally conceived to reduce degeneracy in set partitioning problems by utilizing an aggregated restricted master problem obtained from a partition of the set partitioning constraints into disjoint clusters. In this work, we explore the use of DCA within a CG algorithm for MSSC exact solution. Our method is fine-tuned by a series of ablation studies on DCA design choices, and is demonstrated to significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art exact approaches available in the literature."

However, the latent states learned by the dynamics network make its planning process opaque. This paper aims to demystify MuZero's model by interpreting the learned latent states. We incorporate observation reconstruction and state consistency into MuZero training and conduct an in-depth analysis to evaluate latent states across two board games: 9x9 Go and Gomoku, and three Atari games: Breakout, Ms. Pacman, and Pong. Our findings reveal that while the dynamics network becomes less accurate over longer simulations, MuZero still performs effectively by using planning to correct errors. Our experiments also show that the dynamics network learns better latent states in board games than in Atari games. These insights contribute to a better understanding of MuZero and offer directions for future research to improve the performance, robustness, and interpretability of the MuZero algorithm.

Assessment of WMH is important in research and clinics. However, WMH are challenging to segment due to their high variability in shape, location, size, poorly defined borders, and similar intensity profile to other pathologies (e.g stroke lesions) and artefacts (e.g head motion). In this work, we assess the utility and semantic properties of the most effective techniques for uncertainty quantification (UQ) in segmentation for the WMH segmentation task across multiple test-time data distributions. We find UQ techniques reduce 'silent failure' by identifying in UQ maps small WMH clusters in the deep white matter that are unsegmented by the model. A combination of Stochastic Segmentation Networks with Deep Ensembles also yields the highest Dice and lowest Absolute Volume Difference % (AVD) score and can highlight areas where there is ambiguity between WMH and stroke lesions. We further demonstrate the downstream utility of UQ, proposing a novel method for classification of the clinical Fazekas score using spatial features extracted from voxelwise WMH probability and UQ maps. We show that incorporating WMH uncertainty information improves Fazekas classification performance and calibration. Our model with (UQ and spatial WMH features)/(spatial WMH features)/(WMH volume only) achieves a balanced accuracy score of 0.74/0.67/0.62, and root brier score of 0.65/0.72/0.74 in the Deep WMH and balanced accuracy of 0.74/0.73/0.71 and root brier score of 0.64/0.66/0.68 in the Periventricular region.

The index construction step of these LSHs relies on grouping data points into several bins of hash tables based on their hashcode. To generate an $m$-dimensional hashcode of the $d$-dimensional data point, these LSHs first project the data point onto a $d$-dimensional random Gaussian vector and then discretise the resulting inner product. The time and space complexity of both \\ELSH~and \\SRP~for computing an $m$-sized hashcode of a $d$-dimensional vector is $O(md)$, which becomes impractical for large values of $m$ and $d$.

To this end, we introduce BEARCUBS, a \"small but mighty\" benchmark of 111 information-seeking questions designed to evaluate a web agent's ability to search, browse, and identify factual information from the web. Unlike prior web agent benchmarks, solving BEARCUBS requires (1) accessing live web content rather than synthetic or simulated pages, which captures the unpredictability of real-world web interactions; and (2) performing a broad range of multimodal interactions (e.g., video understanding, 3D navigation) that cannot be bypassed via text-based workarounds. Each question in BEARCUBS has a corresponding short, unambiguous answer and a human-validated browsing trajectory, allowing for transparent evaluation of agent performance and strategies. A human study confirms that BEARCUBS questions are solvable but non-trivial (84.7% human accuracy), revealing domain knowledge gaps and overlooked details as common failure points. By contrast, state-of-the-art computer-using agents underperform, with the best-scoring system (OpenAI's Operator) reaching only 23.4% accuracy. These results highlight critical areas for improvement, including reliable source selection and more powerful multimodal capabilities. To facilitate future research, BEARCUBS will be updated periodically to replace invalid or contaminated questions, keeping the benchmark fresh for future generations of web agents."

        "summary": "arXiv:2504.10733v3 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is one of the most promising candidates to achieve the quantum advantage in solving combinatorial optimization problems. The process of finding a good set of variational parameters in the QAOA circuit has proven to be challenging due to multiple factors, such as barren plateaus. As a result, there is growing interest in exploiting parameter transferability, where parameter sets optimized for one problem instance are transferred to another that could be more complex either to estimate the solution or to serve as a warm start for further optimization. But can we transfer parameters from one class of problems to another? Leveraging parameter sets learned from a well-studied class of problems could help navigate the less studied one, reducing optimization overhead and mitigating performance pitfalls. In this paper, we study whether pretrained QAOA parameters of MaxCut can be used as is or to warm start the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) circuits. Specifically, we design machine learning models to find good donor candidates optimized on MaxCut and apply their parameters to MIS acceptors. Our experimental results show that such parameter transfer can significantly reduce the number of optimization iterations required while achieving comparable approximation ratios."

This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of radiomics-based and deep learning-based approaches for disease detection in chest radiography, focusing on COVID-19, lung opacity, and viral pneumonia. While deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks and vision transformers, learn directly from image data, radiomics-based models extract handcrafted features, offering potential advantages in data-limited scenarios. We systematically compared the diagnostic performance of various AI models, including Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, and Multi-Layer Perceptrons for radiomics, against state-of-the-art deep learning models such as InceptionV3, EfficientNetL, and ConvNeXtXLarge. Performance was evaluated across multiple sample sizes. At 24 samples, EfficientNetL achieved an AUC of 0.839, outperforming SVM with an AUC of 0.762. At 4000 samples, InceptionV3 achieved the highest AUC of 0.996, compared to 0.885 for Random Forest. A Scheirer-Ray-Hare test confirmed significant main and interaction effects of model type and sample size on all metrics. Post hoc Mann-Whitney U tests with Bonferroni correction further revealed consistent performance advantages for deep learning models across most conditions. These findings provide statistically validated, data-driven recommendations for model selection in diagnostic AI. Deep learning models demonstrated higher performance and better scalability with increasing data availability, while radiomics-based models may remain useful in low-data contexts. This study addresses a critical gap in AI-based diagnostic research by offering practical guidance for deploying AI models across diverse clinical environments."

Here we show this feasibility using Neural General Circulation Model (NeuralGCM), a hybrid ML-physics atmospheric model developed by Google, for seasonal predictions of large-scale atmospheric variability and Northern Hemisphere tropical cyclone (TC) activity. Inspired by physical model studies, we simplify boundary conditions, assuming sea surface temperature (SST) and sea ice follow their climatological cycle but persist anomalies present at the initialization time. With such forcings, NeuralGCM can generate 100 simulation days in ~8 minutes with a single Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), while simulating realistic atmospheric circulation and TC climatology patterns. This configuration yields useful seasonal predictions (July to November) for the tropical atmosphere and various TC activity metrics. Notably, the predicted and observed TC frequency in the North Atlantic and East Pacific basins are significantly correlated during 1990 to 2023 (r=~0.7), suggesting prediction skill comparable to existing physical GCMs. Despite challenges associated with model resolution and simplified boundary forcings, the model-predicted interannual variations demonstrate significant correlations with the observation, including the sub-basin TC tracks (p<0.1) and basin-wide accumulated cyclone energy (p<0.01) of the North Atlantic and North Pacific basins. These findings highlight the promise of leveraging ML models with physical insights to model TC risks and deliver seamless weather-climate predictions."

Existing methods for synthesising Colour Fundus Photographs (CFPs) largely rely on predefined disease labels, which restricts their ability to generate images that reflect fine-grained anatomical variations, subtle disease stages, and diverse pathological features beyond coarse class categories. To overcome these challenges, we first introduce an innovative pipeline that creates a large-scale, captioned retinal dataset comprising 1.4 million entries, called RetinaLogos-1400k. Specifically, RetinaLogos-1400k uses the visual language model(VLM) to describe retinal conditions and key structures, such as optic disc configuration, vascular distribution, nerve fibre layers, and pathological features. Building on this dataset, we employ a novel three-step training framework, RetinaLogos, which enables fine-grained semantic control over retinal images and accurately captures different stages of disease progression, subtle anatomical variations, and specific lesion types. Through extensive experiments, our method demonstrates superior performance across multiple datasets, with 62.07% of text-driven synthetic CFPs indistinguishable from real ones by ophthalmologists. Moreover, the synthetic data improves accuracy by 5%-10% in diabetic retinopathy grading and glaucoma detection. Codes are available at https://github.com/uni-medical/retina-text2cfp."

Previous work has attempted to mitigate this issue by penalizing the overall length of generated samples during reinforcement learning (RL), with the goal of encouraging a more concise chains of thought. However, we observe that such global length penalty often lead to excessive compression of critical reasoning steps while preserving unnecessary details in simpler ones, yielding a suboptimal trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. To address this issue, we propose SmartThinker, a two-stage learnable framework designed to enable fine-grained control over the length of reasoning chains based on the importance of each individual step. In the first stage, SmartThinker adapts a reasoning model to a short-form reasoning mode through rejection sampling combined with supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In the second stage, SmartThinker applies Step-Level Length Control Policy Optimization (SCPO) to refine the model output distribution, which increases the proportion of length allocated to critical steps while reducing redundancy in less important ones. SCPO consists of four core components: an online importance estimator, a step-level length control reward function, a step-level generalized advantage estimation (S-GAE) and a difficulty-adaptive clipping strategy. Working in concert, these components enable SCPO to implement differentiated length control across reasoning steps. Empirical results across multiple reasoning benchmarks and various backbone models demonstrate that SmartThinker significantly reduces redundant reasoning while achieving comparable or even superior performance to existing methods."

However, a finer-grained, segment-specific quantification has remained technically infeasible. Conventional 3D models are forced to process downsampled volumes or isolated patches, sacrificing the global context required to resolve anatomical ambiguity and render reliable landmark localization. To overcome this, we reformulate the 3D challenge as a \\textbf{Parallel Probabilistic Landmark Localization} task along the 1D axial dimension. We propose the \\textbf{Depth-Sequence Transformer (DST)}, a framework that processes full-resolution CT volumes as sequences of 2D slices, learning to predict $N=6$ independent probability distributions that pinpoint key anatomical landmarks. Our DST framework demonstrates exceptional accuracy and robustness. Evaluated on a 100-patient clinical cohort with rigorous 5-fold cross-validation, it achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of \\textbf{0.1 slices}, with \\textbf{96\\%} of predictions falling within a $\\pm1$ slice tolerance. Furthermore, to validate its architectural power, the DST backbone establishes the best result on the public Clean-CC-CCII classification benchmark under an end-to-end evaluation protocol.

Many previous works have attempted to provide the theoretical understanding underlying the success of contrastive learning. Almost all of them rely on a default assumption, i.e., the label consistency assumption, which may not hold in practice (the probability of failure is called labeling error) due to the strength and randomness of common augmentation strategies, such as random resized crop (RRC). This paper investigates the theoretical impact of labeling error on the downstream classification performance of contrastive learning. We first reveal several significant negative impacts of labeling error on downstream classification risk. To mitigate these impacts, data dimensionality reduction method (e.g., singular value decomposition, SVD) is applied on original data to reduce false positive samples, and establish both theoretical and empirical evaluations. Moreover, it is also found that SVD acts as a double-edged sword, which may lead to the deterioration of downstream classification accuracy due to the reduced connectivity of the augmentation graph. Based on the above observations, we give the augmentation suggestion that we should use some moderate embedding dimension (such as $512, 1024$ in our experiments), data inflation, weak augmentation, and SVD to ensure large graph connectivity and small labeling error to improve model performance."

We provide a comprehensive overview of the theoretical foundations underlying various simulation-based inference methods, including neural posterior estimation, neural ratio estimation, neural likelihood estimation, flow matching, and consistency models. We explore the applications of these methods across diverse gravitational wave data processing scenarios, from single-source parameter estimation and overlapping signal analysis to testing general relativity and conducting population studies. Although these techniques demonstrate speed improvements over traditional methods in controlled studies, their model-dependent nature and sensitivity to prior assumptions are barriers to their widespread adoption. Their accuracy, which is similar to that of conventional methods, requires further validation across broader parameter spaces and noise conditions."

Experiment 2, which evaluated core competence, provided a critical insight: some models that appeared unbiased were, in fact, incapable of performing a substantive evaluation, relying instead on superficial keyword matching.\n  This paper introduces the \"Illusion of Neutrality\" to describe this phenomenon, where an apparent lack of bias is merely a symptom of a model's inability to make meaningful judgments.

Specifically, team re-combinations that introduce new freshness impulses sustain success, while persistence impulses from experienced teams are linked to earlier impact. Together, freshness and persistence shape team success across collaboration stages."

Most benchmarks prioritize high-level reasoning over executable code and real-world performance, leaving gaps in understanding true capabilities and risks associated with these models in production. To address this issue, we propose MERA Code, a new addition to the MERA benchmark family, specifically focused on evaluating code for the latest code generation LLMs in Russian. This benchmark includes 11 evaluation tasks that span 8 programming languages. Our proposed evaluation methodology features a taxonomy that outlines the practical coding skills necessary for models to complete these tasks. The benchmark comprises an open-source codebase for users to conduct MERA assessments, a scoring system compatible with various programming environments, and a platform featuring a leaderboard and submission system. We evaluate open LLMs and frontier API models, analyzing their limitations in terms of practical coding tasks in non-English languages. We are publicly releasing MERA to guide future research, anticipate groundbreaking features in model development, and standardize evaluation procedures."

The benefit of using human videos is not only for their scale but more importantly for the richness of scenes and tasks. With a VLA trained on human video that predicts human wrist and hand actions, we can perform Inverse Kinematics and retargeting to convert the human actions to robot actions. We fine-tune the model using a few robot manipulation demonstrations to obtain the robot policy, namely EgoVLA. We propose a simulation benchmark called Ego Humanoid Manipulation Benchmark, where we design diverse bimanual manipulation tasks with demonstrations. We fine-tune and evaluate EgoVLA with Ego Humanoid Manipulation Benchmark and show significant improvements over baselines and ablate the importance of human data.

This work introduces an efficient ACoM method that can compress and quantize any chosen intermediate feature representation of an already trained speech/audio downstream model. Our approach employs task-specific loss guidance alongside residual vector quantization (RVQ) losses, providing ultra-low bitrates (i.e., less than 200 bps) with a minimal loss of the downstream model performance. The resulting tokenizer is adaptable to various bitrates and model sizes for flexible deployment.

Briefly, we aim to find a filter $h^*$, which applied to any music or speech, will maximize the user's satisfaction. This is a black-box optimization problem since the user's satisfaction function is unknown. Substantive work has been done on this topic where the key idea is to play audio samples to the user, each shaped by a different filter $h_i$, and query the user for their satisfaction scores $f(h_i)$. A family of ``surrogate\" functions is then designed to fit these scores and the optimization method gradually refines these functions to arrive at the filter $\\hat{h}^*$ that maximizes satisfaction. In certain applications, we observe that a second type of querying is possible where users can tell us the individual elements $h^*[j]$ of the optimal filter $h^*$. Consider an analogy from cooking where the goal is to cook a recipe that maximizes user satisfaction. A user can be asked to score various cooked recipes (e.g., tofu fried rice) or to score individual ingredients (say, salt, sugar, rice, chicken, etc.). Given a budget of $B$ queries, where a query can be of either type, our goal is to find the recipe that will maximize this user's satisfaction. Our proposal builds on Sparse Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and shows how a hybrid approach can outperform any one type of querying. Our results are validated through simulations and real world experiments, where volunteers gave feedback on music/speech audio and were able to achieve high satisfaction levels. We believe this idea of hybrid querying opens new problems in black-box optimization and solutions can benefit other applications beyond audio personalization."

Traditional detection methods, such as visual inspections and chemical treatments, are invasive, labor intensive, and ineffective for early stage infestations. To bridge this gap, this study proposes a non invasive deep learning based acoustic classification framework for early termite detection. We aim to develop a robust, scalable model that distinguishes termite generated acoustic signals from background noise. We introduce a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network Long Short Term Memory architecture that captures both spatial and temporal features of termite activity. Audio data were collected from termite infested and clean wooden samples. We extracted Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients and trained the CNN LSTM model to classify the signals. Experimental results show high performance, with 94.5% accuracy, 93.2% precision, and 95.8% recall. Comparative analysis reveals that the hybrid model outperforms standalone CNN and LSTM architectures, underscoring its combined strength. Notably, the model yields low false-negative rates, which is essential for enabling timely intervention. This research contributes a non invasive, automated solution for early termite detection, with practical implications for improved pest monitoring, minimized structural damage, and better decision making by homeowners and pest control professionals. Future work may integrate IoT for real time alerts and extend detection to other structural pests."

While supervised regression is the primary method for speech enhancement, audio tokenization is emerging as a promising alternative for a smooth integration with other modalities. However, research on speech enhancement using discrete representations is still limited. Previous work has mainly focused on semantic tokens, which tend to discard key acoustic details such as speaker identity. Additionally, these studies typically employ non-autoregressive models, assuming conditional independence of outputs and overlooking the potential improvements offered by autoregressive modeling. To address these gaps we: 1) conduct a comprehensive study of the performance of acoustic tokens for speech enhancement, including the effect of bitrate and noise strength; 2) introduce a novel transducer-based autoregressive architecture specifically designed for this task. Experiments on VoiceBank and Libri1Mix datasets show that acoustic tokens outperform semantic tokens in terms of preserving speaker identity, and that our autoregressive approach can further improve performance. Nevertheless, we observe that discrete representations still fall short compared to continuous ones, highlighting the need for further research in this area."

DiffRhythm, a pioneering diffusion-based model, advanced the field by generating full-length songs with expressive vocals and accompaniment. However, its performance was constrained by an unbalanced model training dataset and limited controllability over musical style, resulting in noticeable quality disparities and restricted creative flexibility. To address these limitations, we propose DiffRhythm+, an enhanced diffusion-based framework for controllable and flexible full-length song generation. DiffRhythm+ leverages a substantially expanded and balanced training dataset to mitigate issues such as repetition and omission of lyrics, while also fostering the emergence of richer musical skills and expressiveness. The framework introduces a multi-modal style conditioning strategy, enabling users to precisely specify musical styles through both descriptive text and reference audio, thereby significantly enhancing creative control and diversity. We further introduce direct performance optimization aligned with user preferences, guiding the model toward consistently preferred outputs across evaluation metrics.

These highly malleable frequency-domain noise patches enable real-time, lightweight protection with strong generalization across variable-length audio and robust resistance to voice deepfake attacks, all while preserving perceptual quality and speech intelligibility.

In this article, we adopt a best-of-both-worlds approach by training a deep neural network on both kinds of pretext tasks at once. The proposed new architecture is a Vision Transformer with 1-D spectrogram patches (ViT-1D), equipped with two class tokens, which are specialized to different self-supervised pretext tasks but optimized through the same model: hence the qualification of self-supervised multi-class-token multitask (MT2). The former class token optimizes cross-power spectral density (CPSD) for equivariant learning over the circle of fifths, while the latter optimizes normalized temperature-scaled cross-entropy (NT-Xent) for contrastive learning. MT2 combines the strengths of both pretext tasks and outperforms consistently both single-class-token ViT-1D models trained with either contrastive or equivariant learning. Averaging the two class tokens further improves performance on several tasks, highlighting the complementary nature of the representations learned by each class token. Furthermore, using the same single-linear-layer probing method on the features of last layer, MT2 outperforms MERT on all tasks except for beat tracking; achieving this with 18x fewer parameters thanks to its multitasking capabilities. Our SSL benchmark demonstrates the versatility of our multi-class-token multitask learning approach for MIR applications."

Our empirical analysis reveals that existing methods for detecting deepfake audio are often vulnerable to anti-forensic (AF) attacks, particularly those attacked using generative adversarial networks. In this article, we propose a novel collaborative learning method called SHIELD to defend against generative AF attacks. To expose AF signatures, we integrate an auxiliary generative model, called the defense (DF) generative model, which facilitates collaborative learning by combining input and output. Furthermore, we design a triplet model to capture correlations for real and AF attacked audios with real-generated and attacked-generated audios using auxiliary generative models. The proposed SHIELD strengthens the defense against generative AF attacks and achieves robust performance across various generative models. The proposed AF significantly reduces the average detection accuracy from 95.49% to 59.77% for ASVspoof2019, from 99.44% to 38.45% for In-the-Wild, and from 98.41% to 51.18% for HalfTruth for three different generative models.

The methods differ in their empirical accuracies and theoretical convergence guarantees. This paper summarizes the methods and their time complexities, and it applies the methods to the ENST-Drums data set and an original recording from the author's band, evaluating the empirical accuracy with respect to ground-truth drum annotations. The results indicate that projected gradient descent with momentum leads to higher accuracy for a fixed runtime, and it satisfies stronger convergence guarantees."

This work presents a systematic study of Large Audio Model (LAM) as a Judge, AudioJudge, investigating whether it can provide a unified evaluation framework that addresses both challenges. We systematically explore AudioJudge across audio characteristic detection tasks, including pronunciation, speaking rate, speaker identification and speech quality, and system-level human preference simulation for automated benchmarking. We investigate different prompt engineering strategies, finding that audio concatenation combined with in-context learning significantly improves performance across both audio characteristic detection and human preference simulation tasks. We further introduce a multi-aspect ensemble AudioJudge to enable general-purpose multi-aspect audio evaluation. This method decomposes speech assessment into specialized judges for lexical content, speech quality, and paralinguistic features, achieving up to 0.91 Spearman correlation with human preferences on our system ranking benchmark. Robustness analysis reveals that while LAMs maintain strong performance under acoustic noise, they exhibit significant verbosity and positional biases that require careful mitigation."

However, the extent to which they implicitly model symbolic music remains underexplored. This paper investigates how LLMs represent musical concepts by generating symbolic music data from textual prompts describing combinations of genres and styles, and evaluating their utility through recognition and generation tasks. We produce a dataset of LLM-generated MIDI files without relying on explicit musical training. We then train neural networks entirely on this LLM-generated MIDI dataset and perform genre and style classification as well as melody completion, benchmarking their performance against established models. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can infer rudimentary musical structures and temporal relationships from text, highlighting both their potential to implicitly encode musical patterns and their limitations due to a lack of explicit musical context, shedding light on their generative capabilities for symbolic music."

To fill this gap, we propose the Speech-Forensics dataset by extensively covering authentic, synthetic, and partially forged speech samples that include multiple segments synthesized by different high-quality algorithms. Moreover, we propose a TEmporal Speech LocalizaTion network, called TEST, aiming at simultaneously performing authenticity detection, multiple fake segments localization, and synthesis algorithms recognition, without any complex post-processing. TEST effectively integrates LSTM and Transformer to extract more powerful temporal speech representations and utilizes dense prediction on multi-scale pyramid features to estimate the synthetic spans. Our model achieves an average mAP of 83.55% and an EER of 5.25% at the utterance level. At the segment level, it attains an EER of 1.07% and a 92.19% F1 score.

The resulting model has just ~370K parameters and a complexity of ~140 MFLOPS (or ~70 MMACS). With a frame size of 10 ms and a lookahead of only 0.27 ms, the model is well-suited for use with common wideband speech codecs. We evaluate the model's robustness by pairing it with the Opus SILK speech codec (1.5 release) and verify in a P.808 DCR listening test that it significantly improves quality from 6 to 12 kb/s. We also demonstrate that Opus 1.5 together with the proposed bandwidth extension at 9 kb/s meets the quality of 3GPP EVS at 9.6 kb/s and that of Opus 1.4 at 18 kb/s showing that the blind bandwidth extension can meet the quality of classical guided bandwidth extensions thus providing a way for backward-compatible quality improvement."

A method for music similarity learning using multiple networks with individual instrumental signals is effective but faces the problem that using each clean instrumental signal as a query is impractical for retrieval systems and using separated instrumental signals reduces accuracy owing to artifacts. In this paper, we present instrumental-part-based music similarity learning with a single network that takes mixed signals as input instead of individual instrumental signals. Specifically, we designed a single similarity embedding space with separated subspaces for each instrument, extracted by Conditional Similarity Networks, which are trained using the triplet loss with masks. Experimental results showed that (1) the proposed method can obtain more accurate embedding representation than using individual networks using separated signals as input in the evaluation of an instrument that had low accuracy, (2) each sub-embedding space can hold the characteristics of the corresponding instrument, and (3) the selection of similar musical pieces focusing on each instrumental sound by the proposed method can obtain human acceptance, especially when focusing on timbre."

While network-based protocols like Precision Time Protocol (PTP) and Network Time Protocol (NTP) are explored, the impact of SROs on spatial audio reproduction and its perceptual consequences remains underexplored. We propose an audio-domain SRO compensation method using spatial filtering to isolate loudspeaker contributions. These filtered signals, along with the original playback signal, are used to estimate the SROs, and their influence is compensated for prior to spatial audio reproduction. We evaluate the effect of the compensation method in a subjective listening test. The results of these tests as well as objective metrics demonstrate that the proposed method mitigates the perceptual degradation introduced by SROs by preserving the spatial cues."

However, because these linguistic cues remain intact, they can be exploited to identify semantic speech patterns associated with specific speakers. In this work, we present VoxATtack, a novel multimodal de-anonymization model that incorporates both acoustic and textual information to attack anonymization systems. While previous research has focused on refining speaker representations extracted from speech, we show that incorporating textual information with a standard ECAPA-TDNN improves the attacker's performance. Our proposed VoxATtack model employs a dual-branch architecture, with an ECAPA-TDNN processing anonymized speech and a pretrained BERT encoding the transcriptions. Both outputs are projected into embeddings of equal dimensionality and then fused based on confidence weights computed on a per-utterance basis. When evaluating our approach on the VoicePrivacy Attacker Challenge (VPAC) dataset, it outperforms the top-ranking attackers on five out of seven benchmarks, namely B3, B4, B5, T8-5, and T12-5. To further boost performance, we leverage anonymized speech and SpecAugment as augmentation techniques. This enhancement enables VoxATtack to achieve state-of-the-art on all VPAC benchmarks, after scoring 20.6% and 27.2% average equal error rate on T10-2 and T25-1, respectively. Our results demonstrate that incorporating textual information and selective data augmentation reveals critical vulnerabilities in current voice anonymization methods and exposes potential weaknesses in the datasets used to evaluate them."
